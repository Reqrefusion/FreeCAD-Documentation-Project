== Introduction == <!--T:117-->

<!--T:2-->
With the [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] 2D sketches intended for use in other workbenches can be created. 2D sketches are the starting point for many CAD models. They typically define the profiles and paths for operations to create 3D shapes. A model may depend on several sketches for its final shape.

<!--T:198-->
Together with boolean operations defined in the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|16px]] [[Part Workbench|Part Workbench]], the Sketcher Workbench, or "The Sketcher" for short, forms the basis of the [[Constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) method of building solids. Together with [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] operations, it also forms the basis of the [[Feature_editing|feature editing]] methodology of creating solids. But many other workbenches use sketches as well.

<!--T:3-->
The Sketcher workbench features [[#Constraints|constraints]], allowing 2D shapes to follow precise geometrical definitions in terms of length, angles, and relationships (horizontality, verticality, perpendicularity, etc.). A constraint solver calculates the constrained-extent of 2D geometry and allows interactive exploration of the degrees-of-freedom of the sketch.

<!--T:11-->
The Sketcher is not intended for producing 2D blueprints. Once sketches are used to generate a solid feature, they are automatically hidden and Constraints are only visible in Sketch edit mode. If you only need to produce 2D views for print, and don't want to create 3D models, check out the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft workbench]].

== Constraints == <!--T:199-->

<!--T:7-->
Constraints are used to limit the degrees of freedom of an object. For example, a line without constraints has 4 degrees of freedom (abbreviated as "DoF"): it can be moved horizontally or vertically, it can be stretched, and it can be rotated.

<!--T:8-->
Applying a horizontal or vertical constraint, or an angle constraint (relative to another line or to one of the axes), will limit its capacity to rotate, thus leaving it with 3 degrees of freedom. Locking one of its points in relation to the origin will remove another 2 degrees of freedom. And applying a dimension constraint will remove the last degree of freedom. The line is then considered '''fully-constrained'''.

<!--T:9-->
Objects can be constrained in relation to one another. Two lines can be joined through one of their points with the coincident point constraint. An angle can be set between them, or they can be set perpendicular. A line can be tangent to an arc or a circle, and so on. A Sketch may have a number of different solutions, and making it '''fully-constrained''' can mean that just one of these possible solutions has been reached based on the applied constraints.

<!--T:10-->
There are two kinds of constraints: geometric and dimensional. They are detailed in the [[#Tools|Tools]] section below.

=== Edit constraints === <!--T:201-->

<!--T:202-->
When a [[Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint|driving dimensional constraint]] is created, and if the {{MenuCommand|Ask for value after creating a dimensional constraint}} [[Sketcher_Preferences#Display|preference]] is selected (default), a dialog opens to edit its value.

<!--T:203-->
[[Image:Sketcher_Edit_Constraint.png|Sketcher_Edit_Constraint.png]]

<!--T:204-->
You can enter a numerical value or an [[Expressions|expression]], and it is possible to name the constraint to facilitate its use in other expressions. You can also check the {{MenuCommand|Reference}} checkbox to switch the constrain to [[Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint|reference mode]].

<!--T:205-->
To edit the value of an existing dimensional constraint do one of the following:
* Double-click the constraint value in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
* Double-click the constraint in the [[Sketcher_Dialog|Sketcher Dialog]].
* Right-click the constraint in the Sketcher Dialog and select the {{MenuCommand|Change value}} option from the context menu.

=== Reposition constraints === <!--T:206-->

<!--T:207-->
Dimensional constraints can be repositioned in the 3D view by dragging. Hold down the left mouse button over the constraint value and move the mouse. The symbols of geometric constraints are positioned automatically and cannot be moved.

== Profile sketches == <!--T:208-->

<!--T:209-->
To create a sketch that can be used as a profile for generating solids certain rules must be followed:
* The sketch must contain only closed contours. Gaps between endpoints, however small, are not allowed.
* Contours can be nested, to create voids, but should not self-intersect or intersect other contours.
* Contours cannot share edges with other contours. Duplicate edges must be avoided.
* T-connections, that is more than two edges sharing a common point, or a point touching an edge, are not allowed.

<!--T:210-->
These rules do not apply to construction geometry (default color blue), which is not shown outside edit mode, or if the sketch is used for a different purpose. Depending on the workbench and the tool that will use the profile sketch, additional restrictions may apply.

== Drawing aids == <!--T:211-->

<!--T:212-->
The Sketcher Workbench has several drawing aids and other features that can help when creating geometry and applying constraints.

=== Continue modes === <!--T:213-->

<!--T:214-->
There are two continue modes: '''Geometry creation "Continue Mode"''' and '''Constraint creation "Continue Mode"'''. If these are checked (default) in the [[Sketcher_Preferences#Display|preferences]], related tools will restart after finishing. To exit a continuous tool press {{KEY|Esc}} or the right mouse button. This must be repeated if a continuous geometry tool has already received input. You can also exit a continuous tool by starting another geometry or constraint creation tool. Note that pressing {{KEY|Esc}} if no tool is active will exit sketch edit mode. Uncheck the '''Esc can leave sketch edit mode''' [[Sketcher_Preferences#General|preference]] if you often inadvertently press {{KEY|Esc}} too many times.

=== Auto constraints === <!--T:215-->

<!--T:216-->
In sketches that have '''Auto constraints''' checked (default) several constraints are applied automatically. The icon of a proposed automatic constraint is shown next to the cursor when it is placed correctly. Left-clicking will then apply that constraint. This is a per-sketch setting that can be changed in the [[Sketcher_Dialog#Constraints|Sketcher Dialog]] or by changing the {{PropertyView|Autoconstraints}} [[Property_editor|property]] of the sketch.

<!--T:242-->
The following constraints are applied automatically:
* [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Coincident]]
* [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|Point on object]]
* [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal|Horizontal]]
* [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainVertical.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainVertical|Vertical]]
* [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainTangent.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainTangent|Tangent]]
* {{Version|1.0}}: [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainSymmetric.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainSymmetric|Symmetric]] (line midpoint)

=== Snapping === <!--T:217-->

<!--T:218-->
{{Version|0.21}}

<!--T:219-->
It is possible to [[Sketcher_Snap|snap]] to grid lines and grid intersection, to edges of geometry and midpoints of lines and arcs, and to certain angles. Please note that snapping does not produce constraints in and of itself. For example, only if [[#Auto constraints|Auto constraints]] is switched on will snapping to an edge produce a [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|Point on object constraint]]. But just picking a point on the edge would then have the same result.

=== On-View-Parameters === <!--T:220-->

<!--T:221-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:222-->
Depending on the selected option in the [[Sketcher_Preferences#General|preferences]] only the dimensional On-View-Parameters or both the dimensional and the positional On-View-Parameters can be enabled. Positional parameters allow the input of exact coordinates, for example the center of a circle, or the start point of a line. Dimensional parameters allow the input of exact dimensions, for example the radius of a circle, or the length and angle of a line. On-View-Parameters are not available for all tools.

[[Image:Sketcher_On_view_parameters_dimensional.png]]
<translate>
<!--T:224-->
{{Caption|Determining the radius of a circle with the dimensional parameters enabled}}

<!--T:225-->
If values are entered and confirmed by pressing {{KEY|Enter}} or {{KEY|Tab}}, related constraints are added automatically. If two parameters are displayed at the same time, for example the X and Y coordinate of a point, it is possible to enter one value and pick a point to define the other. Depending on the object additional constraints may be required to fully constrain it. Constraints resulting from On-View-Parameters take precedence over those that may result from [[Sketcher_Dialog#Constraints|Auto constraints]].

</translate>
[[Image:Sketcher_ArcExample3.png|300px]]
<translate>
<!--T:226-->
{{Caption|Arc created by entering all On-View-Parameters with resulting automatically created constraints}}

=== Coordinate display === <!--T:227-->

<!--T:228-->
If the '''Show coordinates beside cursor while editing''' [[Sketcher_Preferences#Display|preference]] is checked (default), the parameters of the current geometry tool (coordinates, radius, or length and angle) are displayed next to the cursor. This is deactivated while On-View-Parameters are shown.

== Selection methods == <!--T:229-->

<!--T:230-->
While a sketch is in edit mode the following selection methods can be used:

=== 3D view element selection === <!--T:243-->

<!--T:244-->
As elsewhere in FreeCAD, an element can be selected in the [[3D_view|3D view]] with a single left mouse click. But there is no need to hold down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key when selecting multiple elements. Holding down that key is possible though and has the advantage that you can miss-click without losing the selection. Edges, points and constraints can be selected in this manner.

=== 3D view box selection === <!--T:231-->

<!--T:245-->
Box selection in the 3D view works without using [[Std_BoxSelection|Std BoxSelection]] or [[Std_BoxElementSelection|Std BoxElementSelection]]:
# Make sure that no tool is active.
# Do one of the following:
#* Click in an empty area and drag a rectangle from left to right to select elements that lie completely inside the rectangle.
#* Click in an empty area and drag a rectangle from right to left to also select elements that touch or cross the rectangle.

<!--T:246-->
You can box-select edges and points, constraints cannot be box-selected.

=== 3D view connected geometry selection === <!--T:232-->

<!--T:247-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:248-->
Double-clicking an edge in the 3D view will select all edges directly and indirectly connected with that edge via endpoints. There is no need for the edges to be connected with [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Coincident constraints]], endpoints need only have the same coordinates.

=== Sketcher Dialog selection === <!--T:249-->

<!--T:250-->
Edges and points can also be selected from the Elements section of the [[Sketcher_Dialog|Sketcher Dialog]], and constraints from the Constraints section of that dialog.

== Copy, cut and paste == <!--T:233-->

<!--T:234-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:235-->
The standard keyboard shortcuts, {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|C}}, {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|X}} and {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|V}}, can be used to copy, cut and paste selected Sketcher geometry including related constraints. But these tools are also available from the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Sketcher tools}} menu. They can be used within the same sketch but also between different sketches or separate instances of FreeCAD. Since the data is copied to the clipboard in the form of Python code, it can be used in other ways too (e.g. shared on the forum).

== Tools == <!--T:144-->

<!--T:16-->
The Sketcher Workbench tools are located in the Sketch menu and/or several toolbars. {{Version|0.21}}: Almost all Sketcher toolbars are only displayed while a sketch is in edit mode. The only exception is the [[#Sketcher_toolbar|Sketcher toolbar]] which is only displayed if no sketch is in edit mode.

<!--T:251-->
Some tools are also available from the [[3D_view|3D view]] context menu while a sketch is in edit mode, or from the context menus of the [[Sketcher_Dialog|Sketcher Dialog]].

<!--T:177-->
{{Version|0.21}}: If a sketch is in edit mode the Structure toolbar is hidden as none of its tools can then be used.

== Best practices == <!--T:148-->

<!--T:14-->
Every CAD user develops their own way of working over time, but there are some useful general principles to follow.

<!--T:15-->
* A series of simple sketches is easier to manage than a single complex one. For example, a first sketch can be created for the base 3D feature (either a pad or a revolve), while a second one can contain holes or cutouts (pockets). Some details can be left out, to be realized later on as 3D features. You can choose to avoid fillets in your sketch if there are too many, and add them as a 3D feature.
* Always create a closed profile, or your sketch won't produce a solid, but rather a set of open faces. If you don't want some of the objects to be included in the solid creation, turn them to construction elements with the Construction Mode tool.
* Use the Auto constraints feature to limit the number of constraints you'll have to add manually.
* As a general rule, apply geometric constraints first, then dimensional constraints, and lock your sketch last. But remember: rules are made to be broken. If you're having trouble manipulating your sketch, it may be useful to constrain a few objects first before completing your profile.
* If possible, center your sketch at the origin (0,0) with the Lock constraint. If your sketch is not symmetric, locate one of its points at the origin, or choose nice round numbers for the lock distances.
* If you have the possibility to choose between the Length constraint and the Horizontal or Vertical distance constraints, prefer the latter. Horizontal and Vertical distance constraints are computationally cheaper.
* In general, the best constraints to use are: Horizontal and Vertical constraints; Horizontal and Vertical length constraints; point-to-point Tangency. If possible, limit the use of these: the general Length constraint; edge-to-edge Tangency; Point on object constraint; Symmetric constraint.
* If in doubt about the validity of a sketch once it is complete (features turn green), close the Sketcher dialog and use [[File:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Validate sketch]].

== Tutorials == <!--T:19-->

<!--T:121-->
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=30104 Sketcher Lecture] by chrisb. This is a more than 80 page PDF document that serves as a detailed manual for the Sketcher. It explains the basics of Sketcher usage, and goes into a lot of detail about the creation of geometrical shapes, and each of the constraints.
