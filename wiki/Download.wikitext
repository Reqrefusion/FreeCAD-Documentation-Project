=== Notes for GNU/Linux users === <!--T:6-->

<!--T:51-->
Most distributions carry FreeCAD in their official repositories, however, if the distribution doesn't follow a rolling release model the version they provide might be outdated. Instead you can download the AppImage above, mark it as executable and launch it without installation.

<!--T:54-->
Please see the [[Installing_on_Linux|Installing on Linux]] page for more installation options, including daily packages for Ubuntu and derivatives.

<!--T:55-->
A portable version that doesn't need installation can be achieved by starting FreeCAD with these commands:

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=
cd path/to/directory_containing_AppImage/
chmod +x ./name_of_AppImage_file.AppImage
HOME="$PWD/Settings" FREECAD_USER_HOME="$PWD/Settings" ./name_of_AppImage_file.AppImage
}}

Weekly builds are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows there. For Linux, daily builds are also available: use the [[Ubuntu_Snap|snap package]]'s edge channel or the [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily FreeCAD daily PPA] (the latter only for Debian-based distributions).
