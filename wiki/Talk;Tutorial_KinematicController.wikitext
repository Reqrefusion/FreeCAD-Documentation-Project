Now that the tutorial is finished and proofread, I found something to improve:
# {{Incode|Label.endswith("Driver")}} is smarter than {{Incode|Label[-6:] }}=={{Incode| "Driver"}}.
# If we hand over a driver object rather than a drivers list, we can open several instances of the controller, but:
:* We must use the {{Incode|exec_()}} method only once to launch all created instances.
:* If we use the {{Incode|exec_()}} method with the last created instances, this one gets the "mighty" close button; it closes all controller windows. All other close buttons only close the window that they belong to.


Tutorial updated.

== Use of QDoubleSpinBox instead of QLineEdit and Layouts ==

Have you considered using QDoubleSpinBox instead of QLineEdit? The main benefits would be: getting rid of many string conversions (QDoubleSpinBox ingests floats), automatic validation, respecting localisation and e.g. the use of the mouse wheel for changing values.

Also, using Layouts instead of absolute positions and dimensions would probably be a lot more straight forward, adaptable and in line with other Qt stuff.

It's a great tutorial! [[User:Cweickhmann|Cweickhmann]] ([[User talk:Cweickhmann|talk]]) 14:47, 7 January 2026 (UTC)
