My name is Yorik van Havre, I'm one of the core developers and founders of FreeCAD since 2008, more or less, and currently the chairman of the [https://fpa.freecad.org FPA]. I'm an architect, I live in Brussels, Belgium. See my personal website and blog at http://yorik.uncreated.net (I write a lot about FreeCAD and open-source tools for architects). 

In FreeCAD, I'm mostly responsible for the [[BIM Workbench]], among many other things.
