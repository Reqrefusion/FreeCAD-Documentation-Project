==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The '''Arch Nest''' tool allows to select a flat shape to be a container, and a series of other flat shapes to be organized inside the space defined by the container shape. This is typically needed for CNC operations, where you want to cut a series of pieces out of a base panel, and need to organize those pieces in the best possible compact way so they occupy less space on the panel.

<!--T:5-->
The algorithm behind the Nest tool is in constant evolution, and is currently not fully optimized. In the future the performance of this tool should become much better.

==Usage== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:10-->
# Select the {{MenuCommand|Utils → Panel tools → [[Image:Arch_Nest.svg|16px]] Nest}} option from the menu.
# Select an object to be the container. This object must be flat, and, at the moment, rectangular.
# Click the {{Button|Pick selected}} button to use that object as the container.
# Select a series of other flat objects that you wish to place inside the container. These objects must all be flat and in the same plane as the container.
# Adjust desired options below.
# Start the calculation process.
# At the end of the calculation, click the {{Button|Preview}} button to create a temporary preview of the result.
# If you wish to apply the result (move and rotate the actual shapes into place), click {{Button|OK}}.

==Notes== <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
* All objects must have a face
* At the moment the tool will only work with flat objects that all have the same orientation. 
* At the moment, the container must be rectangular.
* At the moment, margin / spacing between the pieces is not implemented yet
* The calculation can take a lot of time with many objects. That will be optimized in the future
