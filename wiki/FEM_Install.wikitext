== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:56-->
To be able to perform finite element analysis (FEA) within the {{KEY|[[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|24px]] [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]]}}, FreeCAD makes use of two external programs: one is used for generating the [[FEM_Mesh|FEM Mesh]], and the other for numerically solving the actual analysis. You can test if your FreeCAD installation is ready for FEA by running the [[FEM_CalculiX_Cantilever_3D|FEM CalculiX Cantilever 3D]] example which is included with every installation of FreeCAD since v0.17.

{{Caption|Workflow of the FEM Workbench; the workbench calls two external programs to perform meshing of a solid object, and perform the actual solution of the finite element problem}}

=== FEM solver === <!--T:2-->

<!--T:20-->
The default solver to perform finite element calculations is [[FEM_CalculiX|CalculiX]], a simple solver for analysis of structures. FreeCAD writes a CalculiX input file, starts the solver, and reads the output, which can then be presented visually in the viewport; this means the CalculiX binary is standalone and independent from FreeCAD. Given that there are many programs that can generate a mesh, '''it is recommended to install the solver, and make sure it's working first'''.

<!--T:21-->
If the solver is correctly installed, you may run the single command {{incode|ccx}} in the terminal to obtain a simple response:

</translate>
{{SystemInput|User@PC:~$ ccx}}

{{Code|code=
Usage: CalculiX.exe -i jobname
}}
<translate>

<!--T:24-->
If the solver is installed, make sure the FEM Workbench is able to find the binary; go to {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → FEM → CalculiX → Search in known binary directories}}. If you compiled the solver yourself, untick the option, and give the correct path to the binary. For other solvers that could be used with FreeCAD, see [[FEM_Solver|FEM Solver]].

=== FEM mesh generator === <!--T:58-->

<!--T:3-->
In order to create a [[FEM_Mesh|FEM Mesh]], FreeCAD uses [http://gmsh.info/ Gmsh] as the default mesher. Depending on your operating system and your FreeCAD installation Gmsh may be bundled with the FreeCAD installation binaries. If it is not, you can install it separately from FreeCAD and then use the menu {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → FEM → Gmsh}} to set the path to the ''gmsh.exe''.

<!--T:25-->
If the program is correctly installed, you may run the command {{incode|gmsh}} in the terminal to launch the graphical interface of the program. This interface is not used by FreeCAD but demonstrates that the program is installed.

<!--T:28-->
If the mesher is installed, make sure the FEM Workbench is able to find the binary; go to {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → FEM → Gmsh → Search in known binary directories}}. If you compiled the mesher yourself, untick the option, and give the correct path to the binary. See [[FEM_Mesh|FEM Mesh]] for various possibilities of obtaining a valid mesh for analysis.

=== Netgen === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:67-->
In order to create a FEM Mesh, you can use ''Netgen'' as an alternative to ''Gmsh''. Depending on your operating system and your FreeCAD installation, Netgen may be bundled with the FreeCAD installation binaries.

<!--T:34-->
If the program is correctly installed, you can run the command {{incode|netgen}} in the terminal under Linux to launch the graphical interface of the program:

</translate>
{{SystemInput|User@PC:~$ netgen -V}}
<translate>

<!--T:72-->
{{VersionPlus|1.0}}: A new improved Netgen implementation is available. Thanks to it, Netgen can finally be used with FreeCAD on Linux. Netgen Python bindings have to be installed to use the new implementation:

<!--T:73-->
{{Code|code=
pip install --upgrade ngsolve
}}

<!--T:74-->
If the above command is not sufficient, one can try the following from the [[Python_Console|Python Console]] in FreeCAD:

<!--T:75-->
{{Code|code=
import os, subprocess
temp_dir = os.path.dirname(os.sys.executable)
py_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, "python")
subprocess.run([py_path, "-m", "pip", "install", "--user", "netgen-mesher"])
}}

<!--T:76-->
or compile Netgen from the source. This might be necessary for Windows users and computers with old CPUs - an explanation can be found in [https://forum.ngsolve.org/t/problems-with-netgen-pip-package/3078/2 this] thread on the Netgen forum.

<!--T:77-->
{{VersionPlus|1.1}}: Installation using the standard procedures described on the [https://ngsolve.org/downloads Netgen download page] should work. It is only necessary to set the path to the Python executable for which Netgen libraries are installed in the [[FEM_Preferences#Netgen|Preferences]]. By default, the Python executable specified in [[Preferences_Editor#Python|General Python preferences]] is used.

<!--T:78-->
{{VersionPlus|1.1}}: Thanks to the new installation method, it is now also possible to use the python3-netgen package provided by Linux distributions unless they are outdated. For example, the version provided by Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is too old (6.2.1905, from 2019) and won't work in FreeCAD while the version provided by Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is 6.2.2401 and works in FreeCAD.

== Installing on Windows == <!--T:59-->

<!--T:4-->
The FreeCAD packages available from the [[Download|download]] page already include Gmsh and CalculiX, so no additional software needs to be installed apart from Netgen (see the section above). A better, always up-to-date CalculiX executable than the one included in FreeCAD can be downloaded from the [https://www.dhondt.de/ official CalculiX website]:

<!--T:79-->
[[Image:Ccx_download.PNG|900px]]

<!--T:80-->
The download link is always in the form such as https://www.dhondt.de/calculix_2.22_4win.zip where 2.22 is the version number.

== Installing on Linux == <!--T:5-->

<!--T:37-->
Linux distributions have different ways of installing software. Many distributions have software repositories and package managers; before compiling source code, look in your package manager for {{incode|netgen}}, {{incode|gmsh}}, {{incode|calculix-ccx}} or {{incode|ccx}}, and install them following the instructions of your own distribution.

=== Ubuntu PPA === <!--T:60-->

<!--T:38-->
The [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-stable freecad-stable] and [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily freecad-daily] personal package archives (PPA) provide a more recent version of FreeCAD than is available in the official Ubuntu repositories. These PPAs include the most recent {{incode|netgen}}, {{incode|gmsh}}, and {{incode|calculix-ccx}} packages as well. See [[Installing_on_Linux|Installing on Linux]] for more information on setting up the repositories.

<!--T:39-->
If a PPA is already added to your system, install the packages as follows

</translate>
{{Code|code=
sudo apt-get install netgen
sudo apt-get install gmsh
sudo apt-get install calculix-ccx
}}
<translate>

<!--T:40-->
The [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-community/+archive/ubuntu/ppa freecad-community] PPA also provides {{incode|netgen}}, {{incode|gmsh}}, and {{incode|calculix-ccx}} packages for testing. If they are stable enough, they may be added to the daily or stable repositories. The binaries for ccx 2.14 work on Debian Stretch, but not on Debian Buster due to dependency problems.

<!--T:7-->
{{Emphasis|Note:}} the thread [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10393 Ubuntu Repository] discusses the creation of the Ubuntu PPA packages. At the time it was written, CalculiX was not included in the Debian repositories, so there were several personal packages in Launchpad. Only one package should be installed.

=== Arch Linux === <!--T:61-->

<!--T:41-->
Get the CalculiX package from the [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/calculix/ AUR repository].

=== Debian === <!--T:62-->

<!--T:42-->
* Debian 9 Buster: the packages in the [https://packages.debian.org/buster/calculix-ccx repository] are outdated, but you can use the packages from the Ubuntu PPA ({{incode|freecad-community}}). See [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&start=10#p279925 Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA] (forum post).
* Debian 8 Stretch: the packages in the [https://packages.debian.org/stretch/calculix-ccx repository] are outdated, but you can use the packages from the Ubuntu PPA ({{incode|freecad-community}}). See [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&p=279925#p260872 Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA] (forum post).
* Debian 7 Jessie: install the packages from Debian 8 Stretch using {{incode|dpkg}}. See [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5975&p=110597#p110597 Debian source package for Calculix] (forum post).

=== openSUSE === <!--T:63-->

<!--T:64-->
* [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Science_Math#Mesh_Generation_and_Related_Tools  openSUSE:Science Math]
* [https://software.opensuse.org/package/netgen netgen Automatic 3D tetrahedral mesh generator]
* [https://software.opensuse.org/package/gmsh gmsh A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator]
* [https://software.opensuse.org/package/ccx ccx An open source finite element package]

<!--T:65-->
Additional packages are typically installed with YAST (abbr. Yet another Setup Tool) the Linux operating system setup and configuration tool, or in any terminal/console (root rights required) with:

</translate>
:{{Code|code=
zypper install netgen
zypper install gmsh
zypper install ccx
}}
<translate>

=== CalculiX binary === <!--T:66-->

<!--T:14-->
The CalculiX authors provide a pre-compiled Linux binary of the solver; it can be downloaded from the [http://www.dhondt.de/ authors' website]. However, since different Linux distributions have different library paths, most likely this binary will not work without making some adjustments.

<!--T:43-->
To use the binary with Fedora 21, see the thread [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10140 Making FEM run on linux fedora 21]. For newer Fedora versions, you should compile CalculiX yourself.

<!--T:44-->
If you use this binary, check that the binary is executable, that it is in the executable {{incode|$PATH}} of your system, and that you have the necessary version of the libraries ({{incode|libgfortran}}, {{incode|liblapack}}, {{incode|libblas}}, etc.) against which it was compiled. This is mentioned in the forum post [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=11830&start=20#p95741 FEM WB].

<!--T:45-->
Use the command {{incode|ldd}} to see the libraries that are linked by the binary. Install any missing dependency.

<!--T:68-->
One of the aforementioned dependencies ({{incode|libgfortran.so.4}}) needed for CalculiX may cause issues with newer Ubuntu releases where only {{incode|libgfortran5}} is available. Apart from using the old CalculiX version (2.17) available via {{incode|sudo apt-get install calculix-ccx}}, one may build a new version of CalculiX. It's not necessary to do it manually since there is a script hosted on [https://www.feacluster.com/install/install this website] that can be obtained and used with the following commands:

<!--T:69-->
{{Code|code=
wget https://feacluster.com/install/install
perl install
}}

<!--T:70-->
The script is interactive and asks for some inputs like the matrix solver type (Spooles or Pardiso). To build a different version of CalculiX just change the following line in the script:

<!--T:71-->
{{Code|code=
$version = '2.2x';
}}

=== Compile CalculiX === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:48-->
Since CalculiX is a standalone application, you can either install a binary packaged for your distribution, or compile it yourself. Any CalculiX version from 2.7.x onwards should work with FreeCAD, and since the code hasn't changed much in years, lower versions than 2.7.x may work as well.

<!--T:49-->
Compiling CalculiX is a task for experienced users, requiring editing the Makefiles and build options in different platforms. See the following information:
* Debian: [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5975&start=10 Debian source package for Calculix], [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31360&start=10#p260506 Gmsh 4 package available for testing in Community Extras PPA], [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=34024 Compiling CalculiX ccx on fedora, ubuntu and debian].
* Fedora 27, 28, 29: [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=34024 Compiling CalculiX ccx on fedora, ubuntu and debian].
* There is a CMake version of the source package in a [https://github.com/ricortiz/CalculiX-cmake github repository], but at the FreeCAD forums no one has reported if this package works.

=== Compile Netgen === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:50-->
Netgen was originally linked by FreeCAD when FreeCAD used OCE, the community fork of OpenCascade (OCCT). As OCE lagged in development behind OCCT, FreeCAD switched back to OCCT. This broke the linking of Netgen, which could only link against OCCT 6.9 or OCE 0.18 and below. As OCCT 7.x versions improved the core functionality of FreeCAD, it was decided to drop Netgen support in favor of Gmsh.

<!--T:51-->
Since then some success has been achieved patching and linking newer versions of Netgen against OCCT 7.x. Nevertheless, the inclusion of Netgen with FreeCAD is still problematic.
