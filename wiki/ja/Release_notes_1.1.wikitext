| The [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|24px]] [[Std TransformManip|Transform]] tool was overhauled and now allows for precise inputs besides dragging in the 3D view. It is possible to align the interactive dragger to any element in the document and to transform the object in that local (U, V, W) coordinate system of the dragger, or in the global document coordinate system. The dragger can be aligned to the object's origin as before, and also to the center of mass of the object. It has a new feature to move the object (at the location of the dragger) to a target location in the document and flip the orientation. See all [[Std_TransformManip#Options|new options]].

| Advanced options for axis-specific alignment of the [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|24px]] [[Std_TransformManip#Options|Transform tool's]] ''Move to Other Object'' command have been added, enabling selective alignment by individual translation and rotation axes. This allows more precise control when matching an object's position and orientation to a target if only selected axis components should be considered.

* The [[Draft_AutoGroup|Draft AutoGroup]] and the [[Draft_AddToGroup|Draft AddToGroup]] commands have been improved. The menus of both commands are sorted alphabetically. In the menu of the [[Draft_AutoGroup|Draft AutoGroup]] command layers are separated from groups, and the ''New layer'' option prompts for a name and activates the layer. The actions of both commands have been made undoable. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18172 Pull request #18172] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19312 Pull request #19312]

* A planar face and an edge can now be selected for the [[Draft_SelectPlane|Draft SelectPlane]] command. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19728 Pull request #19728]
* For clarity the ''Filled'' checkbox in the task panel of for example [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] has been relabeled to ''Make face''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19738 Pull request #19738]
* The texts of newly created dimensions are now oriented automatically relative to the current working plane. A [[Fine-tuning#Draft_Workbench|fine-tuning]] parameter is available to disable this behavior. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20072 Pull request #20072]
* [[Draft_Snap_Near|Near snap]] no longer overrides other snaps. On-object snaps, such as [[Draft_Snap_Midpoint|Midpoint snap]] and [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Endpoint snap]], within ''snapRange'' of the cursor are now detected. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20118 Pull request #20118]
* In the [[Draft_Preferences#Texts_and_dimensions|Draft Preferences]] a dropdown to select the font name for texts, dimensions and labels has been introduced. Previously the name had to be entered manually. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20400 Pull request #20400]
* The ''Continue'' option is now stored separately for each Draft and BIM command. For the [[Draft_Dimension|Draft Dimension]] command the old ''Continue'' option has been re-labeled to ''Chained mode'' for clarity, and a new ''Continue'' option has been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20748 Pull request #20748]
* The [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]] command has seen several improvements. The font file is no longer a preference, instead the last selected file is stored. For the initial value of the font file an attempt is made to get a suitable file from the OS. This is primarily to help users who are not aware of font file locations. The last entered text and height are also stored. A ''Global'' option has been added to task panel. By unchecking that checkbox, coordinates can  be specified in the [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]] coordinate system. Finally, TrueType Collection font files ({{FileName|.ttc}}) can now also be selected, but only the first font in such a file can be used. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21004 Pull request #21004], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21054 Pull request #21054] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21124 Pull request #21124]

If its checkbox ''Pipeline only'' is enabled, a newly refactored CalculiX solver object is added to the Analysis container when using the ''Solver CalculiX'' option. It has an updated task panel, doesn't generate [[FEM_ResultShow|CCX_Results objects]] (only the [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|results pipeline object]] is created) and will be further developed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20609 Pull request #20609]
* The ''Offset'' property was added to [[FEM_ElementGeometry2D|Shell Plate Thickness]], making it possible to offset the expanded shell from the actual mesh. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22385 Pull request #22385]

* The origin feature in a PartDesign body makes use of the new core datums. The appearance has been changed and the planes enlarge when creating a new sketch. As the orientation was wrong in older FreeCAD versions, files created with these versions need to be converted on opening. It can break files which reference the datums, and converted or new files created with {{VersionPlus|1.1}} will be broken in {{VersionMinus|1.0}}.

* It is now possible to directly use external geometry as input for tools like offset or transform (array), for both external construction and defining geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17615 Pull request #17615]
* External geometry (projected or intersecting) is now by default real (defining) geometry (which does not need to be traced as in 1.0 and prior). It can be toggled to construction geometry as any other geometry [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17736 Pull request #17736]
* The Sketcher axes are now displayed with infinite length. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17312 Pull request #17312]
* Sketches are now ordered alphabetically in the [[Sketcher_MapSketch|Attach sketch]] dialog. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16518 Pull request #16518]
* Group dragging was added, making it possible to drag all the selected geometrical entities. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18273 Pull request #18273]
* There is a new preference that, if checked, makes external geometry creation independent of the current construction mode - it is always created as reference geometry in such a case. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18697 Pull request #18697]
* A preference was added to allow optional grouping of the [[Sketcher_CreateLine|Line]] and [[Sketcher_CreatePolyline|Polyline]] tools. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20165 Pull request #20165]
* When selecting a constraint or a geometry element within the sketch, the corresponding Tasks panel list is now automatically scrolled to that object. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18859 Pull request #18859] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20866 Pull request #20866]

* Sketches are now automatically scaled after entering the first dimension to avoid breaking the shape when the first dimension is much larger/smaller than the current size of the geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21084 Pull request #21084]
* When creating geometry the mouse movement is ignored if a value is entered in the [[Sketcher_Workbench#On-View-Parameters|on-view-parameters]] (OVP). Tab cycles between OVP input boxes and Enter now confirms. Deleting the value of an OVP input box enables mouse movement for the dimension again. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20925 Pull request #20925]
* Rendering of geometry lines is now prioritized over constraints so that dimensions lines don't cover the geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21982 Pull request #21982]
