== 概要 ==

The [[Combo_View|Combo View]] appears in a panel called '''Model'''. It combines the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] (upper section) and the [[Property_View|Property View]] (lower section).

The [[Task_Panel|Task Panel]], which used to be part of the Combo View, is a separate panel called '''Tasks''' in {{VersionPlus|1.0}}. It can be [[#Dock_Task_Panel_on_top_of_Combo_View|docked]] on top of the Combo View to achieve the compact layout of earlier versions.

# Move the cursor to the very top of the Task Panel.
# The arrow becomes a hand.
