==Introduction==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
FreeCADのインターフェイスは現代的な[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(toolkit) Qt]ツールキットを基盤としているため最先端の構成を備えています。ウィジット、メニュー、ツールバーやその他のツールは変更、移動、ワークベンチ間での共有が可能です。またキーボードショートカットを設定、変更したり、マクロを記録、再生したりすることもできます。カスタマイズ用ウィンドウはメニューの{{MenuCommand|Tools -> Customize}} で開くことができます。

==Usage==

# The commands available in the Customize dialog box depend on the workbenches that have been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.  So you should first load all workbenches whose commands you want to have access to.
# There are several ways to invoke the [[Image:Std_DlgCustomize.svg|16px]] [[Std_DlgCustomize|Std DlgCustomize]] command:
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Tools → [[Image:Std_DlgCustomize.svg|16px]] Customize...}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click a toolbar area and choose {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Std_DlgCustomize.svg|16px]] Customize...}} from the context menu.
# The '''Customize''' dialog box opens. For more information see [[#Options|Options]].
# The {{Button|Help}} button does not work at this time.
# Press the {{Button|Close}} button to close the dialog box.

==Options==

In the Customize dialog box the following tabs are available:

===Keyboard===

[[Image:Std_DlgCustomize_tab_Keyboard.png]]
{{Caption|The Keyboard tab}}

On this tab custom keyboard shortcuts can be defined. Shortcuts for macro commands can be defined on the [[#Macros|Macros]] tab.

====Search====

You can search for commands by entering at least 3 characters of their menu text or name in the search field. The search is case-insensitive.

It is also possible to search for shortcuts:
* In the search field special keys in shortcuts must be entered as strings. For example to search for commands that use {{KEY|Ctrl}} in their shortcut enter {{Value|ctrl}} (4 letters).
* Add parenthesis to search for single character shortcuts, for example: {{Value|(c)}}.
* Add a comma and space between the characters of multi-character shortcuts, for example: {{Value|g, b, b}}.

====Add a shortcut====

# Select a command category from the '''Category''' dropdown list.
# Select a command from the '''Commands''' panel.
#* Optionally click the {{Value|Command}}, {{Value|Shortcut}} or {{Value|Default}} column headings to reorder the list.
#* Optionally drag the splitter to the right of the panel to resize it.
# The '''Current shortcut''' box displays the current short cut, if available.
# Enter a new shortcut in the '''New shortcut''' input box. Shortcuts can be up to 4 inputs long. Each input is either a single character, a combination of one or more special keys or a combination of one or more special keys and a character. Use {{KEY|Backspace}} to correct mistakes.
# Other active commands (see [[#Notes|Notes]]) that already use the shortcut will be listed in the '''Shortcut priority list'''.
# Press the {{Button|Assign}} button to assign the new shortcut.
# If the '''Shortcut priority list''' contains more than one command: optionally change its order by selecting individual commands and pressing the {{Button|Up}} button or the {{Button|Down}} button. If active commands share the same shortcut, the shortcut will trigger the one that is highest in the list.

====Remove a shortcut====

# Select a command category from the '''Category''' dropdown list.
# Select a command from the '''Commands''' panel.
# Press the {{Button|Clear}} button.

====Restore a default shortcut====

# Select a command category from the '''Category''' dropdown list.
# Select a command from the '''Commands''' panel.
# Press the {{Button|Reset}} button.

====Restore all default shortcuts====

# Press the {{Button|Reset All}} button.

====Notes====

* Shortcuts only work for active commands. Active commands are commands that appear in the standard menu, or in the menu of the active workbench, or commands that appear in a ''visible'' toolbar.

===Toolbars===

[[Image:Std_DlgCustomize_tab_Toolbars.png]]
{{Caption|The Toolbars tab}}

On this tab custom toolbars can be created and modified.

====Search====

See [[#Search|Keyboard]].

====Select the workbench====

# In the dropdown list on the right select the workbench whose custom toolbars you want to modify. The {{Value|Global}} option is there for custom toolbars that should be available in all workbenches.

====Create a toolbar====

# Press the {{Button|New...}} button.
# Enter a name in the dialog box that opens.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
# The new toolbar will appear in the panel on the right.

====Rename a toolbar====

# Select a toolbar in the panel on the right.
# Press the {{Button|Rename...}} button.
# Enter a new name in the dialog box that opens.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.

====Delete a toolbar====

# Select a toolbar in the panel on the right.
# Press the {{Button|Delete}} button.

====Disable a toolbar====

# Uncheck the checkbox in front of the toolbar name in the panel on the right.
# A disabled toolbar will be invisible in the FreeCAD interface.

====Add a command====

# At least one custom toolbar is required. See [[#Create_a_toolbar|Create a toolbar]].
# Select the correct toolbar in the panel on the right. If no toolbar is selected, the command will be added to the first toolbar in the list.
# Select a command category from the '''Category''' dropdown list. Macro commands that have been set up on the [[#Macros|Macros]] tab appear in the {{Value|Macros}} category.
# Select a command from the '''Commands''' panel, or select {{Value|<Separator>}} to add a separator (a line between two toolbar buttons).
#* Optionally drag the splitter to the right of the panel to resize it.
# Press {{Button|[[Image:Button_right.svg|16px]]}} button.

====Remove a command====

# If required, expand the toolbar in the panel on the right.
# Select a command.
# Press {{Button|[[Image:Button_left.svg|16px]]}} button.

====Change a command position====

# If required, expand the toolbar in the panel on the right.
# Select a command.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Button_up.svg|16px]]}} button or the {{Button|[[Image:Button_down.svg|16px]]}} button.
# Optionally repeat this until the command is in the correct position.

====Notes====

* Toolbars belonging to the current workbench are updated immediately, but after disabling/re-enabling a toolbar a workbench change is required (switch to a different workbench and then switch back).
* To update global toolbars a workbench change (if commands have been added or removed) or a restart (if the order of a toolbar has changed or a toolbar was renamed) is required.

===Macros===

[[Image:Std_DlgCustomize_tab_Macros.png]]
{{Caption|The Macros tab}}

On this tab macro commands can be set up. Once set up, they can be added to custom toolbars. Macros installed with the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|16px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] are set up automatically, and added to a {{Value|Global}} toolbar (see [[#Toolbars|Toolbars]]), if you confirm the '''Add button''' popup during the installation process.

If you want to use a macro downloaded from a different source you will have to install it manually. See [[How_to_install_macros|How to install macros]] for more information. Note that FreeCAD uses a dedicated folder for macros and only macros in that folder can be set up. Use the [[Image:Std_DlgMacroExecute.svg|16px]] [[Std_DlgMacroExecute|Std DlgMacroExecute]] command to find this folder on your system.

====Add a macro command====

# In the '''Macro''' dropdown list select a macro.
# Enter a '''Menu text'''. This will be the name used to identify the macro command and will also appear in the toolbar if there is no icon.
# Optionally enter a '''Tool tip'''. This text will appear near the location of the mouse when you hover the toolbar icon.
# Optionally enter a '''Status text'''. This text will appear in the [[Status_bar|status bar]] when you hover the toolbar icon.
# Optionally enter the wiki page for the macro, if available, in the '''What's this''' input box. Enter the page name, not the full URL.
# Optionally enter a shortcut in the '''Accelerator''' input box. See [[#Keyboard|Keyboard]] for more information.
# To add an icon:
## Press the '''Pixmap''' {{Button|...}} button.
## The '''Choose Icon''' dialog box opens.
## If required press the {{Button|Icon folders...}} button to add an icon folder.
## Select an icon from the panel. The '''Choose Icon''' dialog box closes automatically.
# Press the {{Button|Add}} button.
# The macro command appears in the panel on the left.
# The macro command can now be selected on the [[#Toolbars|Toolbars]] tab.

====Remove a macro command====

# Select the macro command in the panel on the left.
# Press the {{Button|Remove}} button.

====Change a macro command====

# Double-click the macro command in the panel on the left.
# Make the required changes. Note that you cannot remove the icon, you can only replace it.
# Press the {{Button|Replace}} button.

==Themes==

FreeCAD supports complete theming of the interface, via .qss stylesheets. The [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html qss format] is very similar to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS css format] used in web pages, it basically adds methods to reference the different widgets and elements of the Qt interface. You can change the default theme (which simply takes the style defined by your desktop system) by selecting a '''style sheet''' in the [[Preferences_Editor#General|FreeCAD preferences]].

You can also create your own theme if you are not satisfied with the themes that are bundled with FreeCAD, for example by editing an [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/src/Gui/Stylesheets existing style sheet]. Your new style must be placed in a specific folder for it to be found by FreeCAD:
* {{FileName|%APPDATA%/FreeCAD/Gui/Stylesheets}} (on Windows). The {{FileName|%APPDATA%}} folder can be retrieved by entering {{Incode|App.getUserAppDataDir()}} in the [[Python_console|Python console]].
* {{FileName|$HOME/.FreeCAD/Gui/Stylesheets}} (on Linux).
* {{FileName|$HOME/Library/Application Support/FreeCAD/Gui/Stylesheets}} (on macOS).

==Addons==

Addons from the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|16px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] offer yet another way to customize the user interface. Several [[Preference_Packs|Preference Packs]] to change the [[#Themes|theme]] are available.

In the Workbenches category of the Addon Manager some addons by user triplus can be found:
* https://github.com/triplus/CubeMenu (for {{VersionMinus|0.20}})
* https://github.com/triplus/Glass.
* https://github.com/triplus/IconThemes
* https://github.com/triplus/Launcher
* https://github.com/triplus/PieMenu
