{{VeryImportantMessage|Please pay attention to the version of FreeCAD used in the tutorial. If a tutorial uses an older version of the program, the general modelling process may still work but some tools may have changed in newer releases. Do not add videos made with version 0.16 or older, as these releases are considered obsolete.}}
