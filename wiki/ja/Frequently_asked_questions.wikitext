<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== What is the easiest way to install FreeCAD on my system? ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If you are on Windows or macOS, the simplest way is to head to the [[Download|Download]] page, where you'll find several ready-to-install packages. If you are on Debian, Fedora or Ubuntu and some other distributions, FreeCAD is already included in the standard software repositories and you can simply install it with the software manager. On Ubuntu, the FreeCAD team also maintains its own [[Installing_on_Linux#Stable_PPA_version|PPA repositories]]. For further details about installation, refer to the installing page for your operating system ([[Installing_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Installing_on_Linux|Linux]] or [[Installing_on_Mac|Mac]]).

=== What are the prerequisites for running FreeCAD? ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In contrast to most 3D CAD software, FreeCAD can run smoothly on the most modest computers - it's been known to run on Pentium IV and Intel Core2 Solo CPUs. If your computer is running a current operating system, chances are FreeCAD will run. The only prerequisite is that your graphics card or chipset must support [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL OpenGL], preferably no older than v2.0. In case of problems, refer to the [[Frequently_asked_questions#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] section of this FAQ.

=== What if I want to compile FreeCAD myself? ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The source code of FreeCAD is always available in the project source code repository. Compiling FreeCAD yourself allows you to use the most recent features being developed, but requires a bit of computer knowledge, although the procedure is fairly simple. Access to the source code is explained [[Compile_on_Linux#Getting_the_source|here]], and we have detailed instructions for compiling on [[Compile_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Compile_on_Linux|Linux]] and [[Compile_on_MacOS|macOS]].

=== FreeCAD tells me some module or application is missing ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD depends on a lot of things to offer all its functionality. All the main required components are usually bundled within your FreeCAD installation or provided by your package manager, so normally you have nothing to worry about. If you installed FreeCAD from unofficial sources, however, or compiled FreeCAD yourself, some piece might be missing, which is not critical to FreeCAD itself, but might cause some functionality to be unavailable. Some specific file formats such as Collada or DWG also require extra components, which cannot be bundled into FreeCAD, and must be installed by yourself separately.
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
All those components and the appropriate way to install them are listed on the [[Extra_python_modules|Extra python modules]] page.

=== FreeCAD doesn't start at all ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
There might be a lot of reasons for that, the most likely is that some library is missing. Try starting FreeCAD from a terminal (type {{SystemInput|freecad}} at a terminal prompt, {{SystemInput|FreeCAD}} on some systems) to see if some error message appears. Also, read the rest of this FAQ as it can give you more clues to detect the cause of the problem. If nothing helps, tell about it on the [https://forum.freecad.org forum], there will surely be someone who can help.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
On some older Windows XP systems you may get an error message like this: {{Emphasis|The application can't start, because the side-by-side configuration is wrong. The reinstallation of the application may solve the problem.}} The reason for this problem is that on your system either the CRT runtime libraries are missing or the version installed is too old because FreeCAD was linked against a newer version. In this case you have to install the {{Emphasis|Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package}} which you'll find at Microsoft. See also the corresponding [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1298&p=9961 forum message].

=== FreeCAD starts normally, but not all icons are displayed, some of them are replaced by a black 'X' ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Some parts of FreeCAD depend on an external Python module called Pivy. On Windows, pivy is included in the FreeCAD installation. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the python-pivy package is part of standard software repositories. On other systems, at the moment, you might have to compile pivy yourself. Note that although some tools are not available without pivy, the rest of FreeCAD works normally.

=== I have display problems, the 3D view doesn't behave correctly, there is garbage when I move/rotate the view, etc. ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD depends on OpenGL for displaying 3D contents, and therefore requires a working OpenGL environment. On some systems, OpenGL is not activated by default, and you might need to install or upgrade your graphics drivers. This problems happens most often on Linux systems or on virtual systems. If you are on a Linux-based system, try the following steps:
* verify that your computer has a 3D-capable graphics board
* type {{SystemInput|glxinfo}} in a terminal window, and check in the output that Direct Rendering is set to "yes", and that the OpenGL vendor/renderer/version matches your graphics card.
* install other OpenGL-based software ([http://www.blender.org Blender], for example) and check if it runs and displays correctly.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== FreeCAD crashes on startup ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A crash might indicate a more serious bug, or some problem in your configuration. Most startup crashes occur because of one of the two following reasons:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==== OpenGL drivers are not installed, or not working properly ====
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This is a very common cause of the problem. The symptoms are simply that FreeCAD crashes at startup, or whenever you open a 3D view (for example by creating a new document). Try to find out what your graphic chip is, then find out if it supports [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL OpenGL] (most recent chips do), then find the correct driver and install it. A good way to doublecheck if OpenGL is available is to try to run another OpenGL application such as [http://www.blender.org blender].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
And as a general tip to get some more information about crashes with FreeCAD you can start it with the program parameter {{SystemInput|--write-log}}. This will create the file {{FileName|FreeCAD.log}} in {{FileName|$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/FreeCAD}} ({{VersionPlus|0.20}}) or {{FileName|$HOME/.FreeCAD}} ({{VersionMinus|0.19}}) on Linux, or {{FileName|$HOME/Library/Preferences/FreeCAD}} on macOS, or {{FileName|%APPDATA%/FreeCAD}} on Windows systems.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In some rare cases you may have a graphic driver installed that doesn't fit to your graphic card. We had a case where the user's laptop had an Intel on-board graphic but some ATI drivers were installed. Refer to forum thread in German [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5160&start=10#p41042 FreeCAD startet nicht]. After removing the files and re-installing the correct driver FreeCAD started to work.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==== Some library, needed by FreeCAD, is not present on your system, or wasn't found by FreeCAD ====
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
There can be two paths to this problem: either some library is simply missing, therefore FreeCAD will refuse to start, or the library is there, but it is an older version than the one FreeCAD expects, so a crash will occur when FreeCAD attempts to use a missing feature from that library. A common example is when you have Qt3 and Qt4 installed on your system, FreeCAD might detect Qt4 but if your Qt installation is not properly configured, some pieces of Qt3 might still be used, provoking crashes.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Please review the installing procedure ([[Installing_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Installing_on_Linux|Linux]] or [[Installing_on_Mac|Mac]]), make sure you installed all the required libraries (on most Linux systems this is done automatically), and check what is the minimum version number for each of the components.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If everything seems correct, describe the problem on the [https://forum.freecad.org forum] or [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues submit a bug]. If you are on a Linux system, it is easy to do a debug backtrace, which provides very useful information about the crash to the developers:
* in a terminal, type: {{SystemInput|gdb freecad}} (assuming package gdb is installed)
* inside gdb, type {{SystemInput|run}}
* after the crash, type {{SystemInput|bt}} to get the backtrace, that you can include in your bug report.

=== FreeCAD freezes after startup ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
When starting FreeCAD the GUI appears almost immediately but the GUI is frozen and the cpu is about 99%. This can happen on the KDE desktop when using the Oxygen theme. That's a bug in the Oxygen theme and choosing another theme should fix this issue.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== FreeCAD crashes on creating a new document or opening a file ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If FreeCAD crashes when it creates a new 3D view, try launching FreeCAD from a terminal. If a message error appears when the crash occurs, mentioning {{SystemOutput|Assertion Failed}}, and a component name beginning with "So" ({{SystemOutput|SoBase}}, {{SystemOutput|SoFieldContainer}}, etc.), the chances are very high, especially if you are on Linux, that FreeCAD is trying to use two different versions of the Coin library, which causes the crash.
To verify if that is indeed the problem, try the following:
* Locate the FreeCAD executable (usually in {{FileName|/usr/lib/FreeCAD/bin}})
* Run the command {{SystemInput|ldd FreeCAD}} from a terminal
* Note down the version of the {{FileName|libCoin.so}} library that FreeCAD is using (for example {{FileName|libCoin.so.60}})
* Locate the {{FileName|libSoQt.so}} library (usually in {{FileName|/usr/lib}})
* run {{SystemInput|ldd libSoQt.so}} and check if it links to the same Coin version as FreeCAD
If there is any difference, either FreeCAD or SoQt must be recompiled (better to recompile the one that uses the oldest Coin version). The normal behavior is to try to contact the people responsible for packaging either SoQt or FreeCAD and kindly ask them to consider recompiling.
If you want to undertake that step for yourself, and it is not possible to recompile SoQt because it breaks other applications on your system, you can force FreeCAD to compile with the required Coin version with {{SystemInput|<nowiki>./configure --with-coin=DIR</nowiki>}}. But you have to make sure that the correct development package of this Coin version is installed.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== FreeCAD crashes after Edit → Alignment ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A segmentation fault happens at {{SystemOutput|vbo_save_playback_vertex_list()}}. This means that the implementation of VBO in the graphic driver is bad. In order to avoid caching OpenGL calls you can try to set the environment variable {{SystemInput|<nowiki>IV_SEPARATOR_MAX_CACHES=0</nowiki>}} and restart FreeCAD.

This can also happen if you had an older version of FreeCAD installed, and you upgraded to a newer version. In that process, the configuration files of FreeCAD might have been corrupted for some reason, and now FreeCAD cannot read them anymore, and fails to start. The solution is simply to delete these configuration files, so FreeCAD will recreate them on first run.

=== How do I extrude stuff into solids? I don't get the right result ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The theory is simple: Lines (or wires), when extruded, form faces. Faces, when extruded, form solids.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If you extrude something and the result is not a solid, then the something was not a face. If you have lines and you want to extrude a solid from them, you must first select lines that form a closed perimeter (select several objects by pressing {{KEY|Ctrl}}), join them into a wire ([[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]] tool), then make a face from that wire ([[File:Draft_Upgrade.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]] tool again). There you are, if all went well you can now extrude it to a solid.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Now, there can be many little twists that make you obtain the wrong result. The best way to make sure is to check what's inside the object you are extruding. Objects contents can be easily explored with python. Assuming for example you have an object called "Wire", you could type this into the Python console:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{code|code=
obj = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.Wire
shp = obj.Shape
print shp.Faces
print shp.Wires
if shp.Wires:
    for w in shp.Wires:
        print w.isClosed()
}}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The above code retrieves the shape from an object, shows the faces and wires your object has (if any), and, if there are wires, prints if those wires are closed. If you don't have any face, you won't get a solid. If there is no closed wire, it won't become a face. If you are interested, there is more info about what you can check with Python on the [[Topological_data_scripting|part scripting]] page. If you cannot join several lines into a wire, the most probable cause is that their endpoints don't meet, there must be small gaps between (some of) them. There, I'm afraid, my experience tells me the quickest way would be to redraw a wire on top of them.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== My boolean operations fail, or give weird results ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Like all solid modeling kernels, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_CASCADE_Technology Open CASCADE] geometric modeling kernel used in FreeCAD for Part geometry, although probably the best open-source geometry kernel available, has flaws and limitations. Boolean operations (fusion, subtraction, intersection) are complicated operations, and often give strange results. This is a current limitation we have no way to solve at once, so your best path is to try obtaining the desired result by modeling another way. For example, problems with primitives such as cylinder can often be solved by using an extruded circle instead. Coplanar surfaces between parts can cause trouble, as well as surface tangency. As a general rule, if a shape doesn't work, try remodeling it a different way. In 99% of the cases at the end you will manage to obtain the result you want.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

=== When I export (or view) my model, the holes are filled in ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Don't use {{KEY|Ctrl}} + {{KEY|A}} (Select All) to export everything from the hierarchy tree. If the model is of one single item, try selecting only the newest item (usually the last one) in the hierarchy tree.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
As we create a model in the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]], each feature takes the shape of the last one and adds or removes something, creating linear dependencies from feature to feature as the model is created. Hence a "Cut" feature is not only the cut hole itself, but the whole part with the cut. This is why the user usually should only have the newest item (feature) in the model tree visible, because otherwise the phases of the model overlay each other, and holes are filled in by the earlier model features.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To toggle visibility of an object on or off, select it in the hierarchy tree and press {{KEY|spacebar}} on your keyboard. Usually everything but the last item in the hierarchy tree should be greyed out and therefore not visible in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

=== My parametric objects break when I modify their base sketches ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
You have met the (in)famous [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological Naming Problem (TNP)]]. This may still be a major issue in FreeCAD for newcomers. It can be present all over FreeCAD, but is more prominent when using [[Sketcher_Workbench|sketches]]. The explanation is simple: When recalculating a sketch, the geometric entities (edges, faces...) are rebuilt in a different order, depending on the constraints precedence. They then receive a different name (Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2...). Most subsequent operations depend on these names to identify which subcomponent they work on. Therefore, when the sketch is rebuilt, features that are based on such subcomponents might suddenly get their base geometry changed and give a wrong result.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{Version|1.0}}: The TNP mitigation code is implemented but it doesn't eliminate the problem entirely and the users should still follow the good practices listed below:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Know that sketches are highly sensitive to the problem. Referencing a specific edge of a sketch, or a face of an object built on a sketch, such as a [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]], is dangerous, unless you are pretty confident that these sketches will not change over time or the sketch is very simple. A Pad built on a simple rectangular sketch, for example, will likely be safe as it will generate only one face, so there is no order problem.
* Prefer other kinds of objects such as [[Part_Workbench|Part]] or [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] when possible. These objects are always built the same way, and therefore their geometric components usually follow the same order each time they are rebuilt. They are much less susceptible to toponaming problems.
* To attach further objects onto the faces of sketch-based geometry, prefer using [[PartDesign_Plane|Datum geometry]]. These invisible "helper objects" don't depend on sketch geometry, and therefore stay stable over time.

* Give some feedback to the FreeCAD developers: It is always useful to know what people think, what they found good, what they miss, etc. Drop a note on the [https://forum.freecad.org forum] giving your opinion or make a request in our [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues Issues section]!
* Help with writing documentation: The documentation we have here on this site is sometimes very limited. If you discovered something that is not well documented, add your knowledge there!
* Help others newcomers: Hang around the forum, and help new people to solve basic questions, like how do I install, how do I add a cube, etc.
* [[Help_FreeCAD#Translate_the_documentation|Translate the documentation]] into your own language
* [[Help_FreeCAD#Translate_FreeCAD|Translate FreeCAD]] into your own language
* Write [[Tutorials|Tutorials]], or record video tutorials: Tutorials are a very easy way for newcomers to learn a new software. If you did some nice stuff, why not show other people how to do it?
* Contribute with assets and examples: We are still missing good example files in FreeCAD. If you created something good, share it with us!
* [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues Submit bugs]: It is very important to have all possible bugs fixed. If you find one, report it as clearly as possible, so we can understand exactly what's happening.
* Try to do some Python coding: You never programmed before but you want to try? Python is easy. Read our [[Introduction_to_Python|introduction to Python]], but beware, you might get addicted quickly!

Sure. All the artwork (icons, banners, etc.) of FreeCAD are licensed LGPL, same as the FreeCAD code. Help yourself on the [[Artwork|Artwork]] page. The website is a standard MediaWiki site, all graphic elements can freely be reused, and if you are curious about how to tweak the MediaWiki software like we did, look for the special Common css and js pages.
