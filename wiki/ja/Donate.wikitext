以下はプロジェクトでサポートしている寄付先のリストです。ご留意いただきたいのは、FreeCADを使ったり、それについて学んだり、配布したり、開発をするのに金銭の支払いは必要ない、ということです。しかしながら、ご寄付をいただけるとFreeCADプロジェクトとその開発者が開発に専念でき、プロジェクトの進展をより促進することができます。

There are also always other ways to help instead of donating money or coding, such as working on the documentation, on translations, or help new users to find their way. See the [[Help FreeCAD]] page to know more.

== Sponsoring ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
We call sponsoring the act of donating money recurrently to the FreeCAD project. You can do that as an individual or as a company or institution, through different channels or platforms, depending on your preferences. You can sponsor FreeCAD via the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsoring page].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Sponsoring FreeCAD allows its developers to count on a steady flow of income, so it allows the FPA to plan things ahead, and the FreeCAD developers to invest themselves more seriously into FreeCAD.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To encourage persons and companies to sponsor the FreeCAD project, we have created different sponsoring tiers. By donating regularly to the project, you will have the possibility to have your name, company name and/or logo to be featured on the FreeCAD website, depending on the tier you fit into:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* ♥ Normal sponsor: from 1 USD / 1 EUR per month. You will not have your name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], but you will have helped the project a lot anyway. Together, normal sponsors maintain the project on its feet as much as the bigger sponsors.
* 🥉 Bronze sponsor: from 25 USD / 25 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page].
* 🥈 Silver sponsor: from 100 USD / 100 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], with a link to your website, and a one-line description text.
* 🥇 Gold sponsor: from 200 USD / 200 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name and logo displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], with a link to your website and a custom description text. Companies that have helped FreeCAD early on will also appear under Gold sponsors.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The FPA has a few [https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/process/accepting-donations.html ground rules] that define types of donation or sponsoring that can be accepted or not.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Instead of donating each month, you might find it more comfortable to make a one-time donation that, when divided by twelve, would give you right to enter a sponsoring tier. Don't hesitate to do so!
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Jobs ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* There might be other developers interested in doing specific work for the project; if you would like to accelerate the development of an idea or feature, consider employing a developer. It's up to you to build up an idea, discuss it on the forum, and find developers interested in doing it. You can offer a job in the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=31 Job offers subforum].
* Modelling jobs are also welcome. Not every experienced FreeCAD user is a developer. Experienced users can help you migrate your projects to FreeCAD, which contributes to popularizing the software in organizations. See [[FreeCAD_used_in_production|FreeCAD used in production]].

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== The FPA ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The '''FreeCAD project association''' (FPA) is a non-profit association created in 2022 by FreeCAD's administrators and core developers and seated in Belgium. It is responsible for transparently collecting, handling and distributing the money collected via donations. More details and reports are available on the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA FPA page].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Tax deductions ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The FPA, although it is a non-profit organization, is not a charity organization. People and companies donating to the FPA are therefore [https://finances.belgium.be/fr/particuliers/avantages_fiscaux/dons not entitled to a tax deduction] by Belgian law. Each country, however, has its own rules and laws to decide upon what gives their citizen right to tax reduction or not. You are always advised to consult the laws of your own country.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The FPA can anyway always issue a donation receipt. [mailto:fpa@freecad.org Mail us] with your donation details and we will gladly send you a receipt.
