<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[Image:Workbench_Spreadsheet.svg|24px]] [[Spreadsheet_Workbench|Spreadsheet Workbench]] allows you to create and edit spreadsheets, use data from the spreadsheet as parameters in a model, fill the spreadsheet with data retrieved from a model, perform calculations, and export the data to other spreadsheet applications such as LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel.

== Removing cells can be dangerous ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Note that deleting or removing cells with data can break the spreadsheet and your model if it relies on the spreadheet. You are not prewarned if this happens.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Insert and remove rows and columns ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Rows and columns can be inserted or removed by right-clicking a row or column header and selecting the appropriate option from the contex menu. It is possible to select multiple rows or columns first. Either by holding down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key while selecting the headers, or by holding down the left mouse button and dragging.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Edit cells ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The content of a cell can be edited by selecting the cell and entering a value in the {{MenuCommand|Content}} inputbox at the top of the window. To edit a cell in-place, select it and press {{KEY|F2}}, or double-click it.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Delete cells ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Select one or more cells. To select multiple cells hold down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key while selecting, or hold down the left mouse button and drag to select a rectangular cell range.
# Do one of the following:
#* Press the {{KEY|Delete}} key.
#* Right-click one of the selected cells and select the {{MenuCommand|[[File:Edit-delete.svg|16px]] Delete}} option from the context menu.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This operation deletes the contents, the properties and the aliases of the cells. To only delete their contents, cells should be [[#Edit_cells|edited]] instead.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Cut, copy and paste cells ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Select one or more cells. See above.
# Do one of the following:
#* Use one the standard shortcuts: {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|X}}, {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|C}} or {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|V}} respectively.
#* Right-click one of the selected cells and select the appropriate option from the context menu.
#* Select the appropriate option from the [[Std_Edit_Menu|Edit Menu]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The cut and copy operations store the contents, properties and aliases of the cells on the Clipboard. The paste operation writes the data in such a way that the content of the top left cell of the stored data is dropped in the active cell. Other stored content is placed relative to that cell. Formulas are updated accordingly. Aliases are only pasted if they are unique.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Cell properties ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The properties of a spreadsheet cell can be edited by right-clicking the cell and selecting {{MenuCommand|Properties…}} from the context menu. The following dialog pops up:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:SpreadsheetCellPropDialog.png]]
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
As indicated by the tabs, the following properties can be changed:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Color: Text color and background color
* Alignment: Text horizontal and vertical alignment 
* Style: Text style: bold, italic, underline
* Units: Display units for this cell.  Please read the [[#Units|Units]] section below.
* Alias: Define an [[Spreadsheet_SetAlias|alias]] for this cell. This alias can be used in cell formulas and also in general [[Expressions|expressions]]; see section [[#Spreadsheet_data_in_expressions|Spreadsheet data in expressions]] for more information.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Cell expressions ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A spreadsheet cell may contain a number, a text or an expression. Expressions must start with an equal sign '='.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Cell expressions may contain numbers, functions, references to other cells, and references to properties of the model (But see [[#Current_limitations|Current limitations]] below). A cell can be referenced by its address (capital column letter + row number, e.g. B4) or by its [[Spreadsheet_SetAlias|alias]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
'''Note:''' Cell expressions are treated by FreeCAD as programming code. Therefore, when you edit a cell the content you see may not follow your display settings:
* The decimal separator is always a dot. But commas can also be used when entering values.
* The number of displayed decimals can differ from your [[Preferences_Editor#Units|preferences settings]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
References to objects in the model are explained under [[#References_to_CAD-data|References to CAD-data]] below. Using spreadsheet cell values to define model properties are explained under [[#Spreadsheet_data_in_expressions|Spreadsheet data in expressions]] below. For more information on expressions and the available functions, see [[Expressions|Expressions]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Interaction between spreadsheets and the CAD model ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Data in the cells of a spreadsheet may be used in CAD model parameter expressions. Thus, a spreadsheet may be used as the source for parameter values used throughout a model, effectively gathering the values in one place. When values are changed in the spreadsheet, they are propagated throughout the model.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Similarly, properties from CAD model objects may be used in expressions in spreadsheet cells. This allows use of object properties like volume or area in the spreadsheet. If the name of an object in the CAD model is changed, the change will automatically be propagated to any references in spreadsheet expressions using the name which was changed.
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
More than one spreadsheet may be used in a document. A spreadsheet can be identified using either its name or its label.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD will automatically assign a unique name to a spreadsheet when it is created. These names follow the pattern {{incode|Spreadsheet}}, {{incode|Spreadsheet001}}, {{incode|Spreadsheet002}} and so on. The name can not be changed, and it is not visible in the properties of the spreadsheet. It can be used to refer to the spreadsheet in an [[Expressions|Expression]] (see [[#Spreadsheet_data_in_expressions|Spreadsheet data in expressions]] below.)
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The label of a spreadsheet is automatically set to the name of the spreadsheet upon creation. Unlike the name, the label can be changed, for example in the properties panel or using the context menu action Rename. By default FreeCAD does not accept duplicate labels, but there is a [[Preferences_Editor#Document|preference]] to override this. Spreadsheets with duplicate labels in the same document cannot be referenced by their label.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD checks for cyclic dependencies. See [[Spreadsheet_Workbench#Current_limitations|Current limitations]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== References to CAD-data ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
As indicated above, one can reference data from the CAD model in spreadsheet expressions.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The following table shows some examples assuming the model has a feature named "MyCube":
{|{{Prettytable}}
 !CAD-Data
 !Cell in Spreadsheet
 !Result
 |-
 |Parametric Length of a Part-Workbench Cube
 |{{Incode|<nowiki>=MyCube.Length</nowiki>}}
 |Length with units mm
 |-
 |Volume of the Cube
 |{{Incode|<nowiki>=MyCube.Shape.Volume</nowiki>}}
 |Volume  in mm&sup3; without units
 |-
 |Type of the Cube-shape
 |{{Incode|<nowiki>=MyCube.Shape.ShapeType</nowiki>}}
 |String: Solid
 |-
 |Label of the Cube
 |{{Incode|<nowiki>=MyCube.Label</nowiki>}}
 |String: MyCube
 |-
 |X coordinate of the center of mass of the Cube
 |{{Incode|<nowiki>=MyCube.Shape.CenterOfMass.x</nowiki>}}
 |Coordinate in mm without units
 |}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== Spreadsheet data in expressions ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In order to use spreadsheet data in other parts of FreeCAD, you will usually create an [[Expressions|Expression]] that refers to the spreadsheet and the cell that contains the data you want to use. You can identify spreadsheets by name or by label, and you can identify the cells by address or by alias. Autocompletion is available for all forms of referencing.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{|{{Prettytable}}
 !
 !Spreadsheet by Name
 !Spreadsheet by Label
 |-
 !Cell by Address
 |{{incode|<nowiki>=Spreadsheet042.B5</nowiki>}}
 |{{incode|<nowiki>=<<MySpreadsheet>>.B5</nowiki>}}
 |-
 !Cell by Alias
 |{{incode|<nowiki>=Spreadsheet042.MyAlias</nowiki>}}
 |{{incode|<nowiki>=<<MySpreadsheet>>.MyAlias</nowiki>}}
 |}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
The recommended way to refer to spreadsheet data is to use the spreadsheet label and cell alias name. For a more in-depth explanation of the pros and cons of the referencing modes, see the expanded section below.
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Using the spreadsheet label has the advantage that it can be freely changed to describe the contents of the spreadsheet. It is also easier to identify the spreadsheet that is being used since the text in the expression matches the label shown in the model and property views. If you decide to change the label of a spreadsheet, existing references to the contents of the spreadsheet will be updated, so you won't break your expressions by renaming the spreadsheet. The internal name of the spreadsheet is not readily available anywhere except within the expression editor, so if you use the internal name and later decide to rename the spreadsheets, you might have a hard time tracing your expression data back to its source.
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Be aware that when you create a new spreadsheet, the name and the label are the same, so it is easy to accidentally use the spreadsheet name instead of the label. A simple way to avoid this is to give the spreadsheet a meaningful name before starting to use it in expressions.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
While you may use the row and column number in an expression to reference a cell, best practice is to give the cell an alias name and use that. See [[#Cell_properties|Cell properties]] on how to set the alias. For example, if the data in cell B1 contained the length parameter for an object, an alias name of {{incode|MyObject_Length}} would allow the value to be referred to as {{incode|<<MyParams>>.MyObject_Length}} instead of {{incode|Spreadsheet.B1}}. Besides being much easier to read and understand, alias names are also much easier to change if you decide to adjust the structure of your spreadsheet. Using an alias also has the advantage that it is reasier to see which cells are used to control other parts of the document. Note that FreeCAD will automatically adjust the positional references in expressions if you insert or remove rows and columns in the spreadsheet, so even if you use row and column numbers in an expression, you can insert rows and columns without breaking the references to the surrounding cells.
</div>

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== Complex models and recomputes ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Editing a spreadsheet will trigger a recompute of the 3D model, even if the changes do not affect the model. For a complex model a recompute can take a long time, and having to wait after every single edit is of course quite annoying.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
There are three solutions to deal with this:
# Temporarily skip recomputes:
#* In the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] right-click the [[Image:Document.svg|24px]] document that contains the spreadsheet.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Skip recomputes}} option from the context menu.
#* There is a big disadvantage to this solution. New values entered in the spreadsheet will not be displayed until the document is recomputed. Instead {{incode|#PENDING}} is shown.
#* You can either recompute manually, using the [[Std_Refresh|Std Refresh]] command, or disable {{MenuCommand|Skip recomputes}} when you are done editing.
# Use a macro to automatically skip recomputes while editing a spreadsheet:
#* Download and run [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=48600#p419301 skipSheet.FCMacro].
#* This solution saves a few steps compared to the first solution, but also has the mentioned disadvantage.
# Put the spreadsheet in a separate [[File_Format_FCStd|FreeCAD file]]:
#* You can reference spreadsheet data from an external {{FileName|.FCStd}} file with this syntax: {{incode|<nowiki>=NameOfFile#<<MySpreadsheet>>.MyAlias</nowiki>}}.
#* The advantage of having the spreadsheet in another file over switching off recomputes is that the spreadsheet itself does get recomputed.
#* The disadvantage is that the model won't automatically recompute after changes to the spreadsheet.
#* In the scenario where you first open the 'spreadsheet' file, change one or more values and then open the 'model' file, there won't be any indication that the model needs to be recomputed. But if both files are open the [[Std_Refresh|Std Refresh]] icon will update correctly for the 'model' file after changes to the 'spreadsheet' file.
</div>

<span id="Units"></span>
== 単位 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The Spreadsheet has a notion of dimension (units) associated with cell values. A number entered without an associated unit has no dimension. The unit should be entered immediately following the number value, with no intervening space. If a number has an associated unit, that unit will be used in all calculations. For example, the multiplication of two lengths with the unit mm gives an area with the unit mm&sup2;.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If a cell contains a value which represents a dimension, it should be entered with its associated unit. While in many simple cases one can get by with a dimensionless value, it is unwise to not enter the unit. If a value representing a dimension is entered without its associated unit, there are some sequences of operations which cause  FreeCAD to complain of incompatible units in an expression when it appears the expression should be valid. (This may be better understood by viewing [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=34713&p=292455#p292438 this thread] in the FreeCAD forums.)
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
You can change the units displayed for a cell value using the [[#Cell_properties|Cell properties dialog]]. This does not change the value contained in the cell; it only converts the existing value for display. The value used for calculations does not change, and the results of formulas using the value do not change. For example, a cell containing the value "5.08cm" can be displayed as "2in" by changing the units tab value to "in".
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A dimensionless number cannot be changed to a number with a unit by the cell properties dialog. One can put in a unit string, and that string will be displayed; but the cell still contains a dimensionless number. In order to change a dimensionless value to a value with a dimension, the value itself must be re-entered with its associated unit.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Occasionally it may be desirable to get rid of a dimension in an expression. This can be done by multiplying by 1 with a reciprocal unit.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Importing and exporting ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== CSV format ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD spreadsheets can be imported and exported to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values CSV] format which can also be read and written by most other spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. See [[Spreadsheet_Import|Spreadsheet Import]] and [[Spreadsheet_Export|Spreadsheet Export]] for more information.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== XLSX format ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Spreadsheets in the Excel-format XLSX can be imported with the [[Std_Import|Std Import]] command or the [[Std_Open|Std Open]] command. The following features are supported:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* All functions that are also available in the FreeCAD spreadsheet. Other functions give an error in the corresponding cell after import.
* Alias names for cells.
* More than one sheet in the Excel-spreadsheet. In this case one FreeCAD spreadsheet is created for each Excel sheet.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Other functionality is not imported into the FreeCAD spreadsheet.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Printing ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To handle the page setup necessary for printing, FreeCAD spreadsheets are printed by inserting them into a [[TechDraw_SpreadsheetView|TechDraw Spreadsheet View]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Current limitations ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD checks for cyclic dependencies when it recomputes. By design, that check stops at the level of the spreadsheet object. As a consequence, you should not have a spreadsheet which contains both cells whose values are used to specify parameters to the model, and cells whose values use output from the model. For example, you cannot have cells specifying the length, width, and height of an object, and another cell which references the total volume of the resulting shape. This restriction can be surmounted by having two spreadsheets: one used as a data-source for input parameters to the model and the other used for calculations based on resultant geometry-data.
</div>

== Cell binding ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{Version|0.20}}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
It is possible to bind the content of cells to other spreadsheet cells. This can be useful when dealing with large tables or to get cell content from another spreadsheet.

<span id="Notes"></span>
=== 補足 ===

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The {{MenuCommand|Hide dependency of binding}} option can be used to prevent problems with cyclic dependencies between spreadsheets. Selecting it is necessary when, for example, cells in ''Spreadsheet A'' are bound to ''Spreadsheet B'', while cells in ''Spreadsheet B'', in turn, are bound to some other cells in ''Spreadsheet A''. This option should be used with caution:
** Hiding dependencies can be dangerous because broken dependencies can damage your FreeCAD file. For example, when you delete a spreadsheet you will not be warned about hidden dependencies.
** When you open a document with a spreadsheet containing a hidden dependency, you will get the spreadsheet marked to be recomputed. This is because a cyclic dependency cannot be recomputed automatically. To recompute the [[Std_Refresh|Std Refresh]] tool must be used.
* The cell binding has a range check and warns you about mismatched ranges. For example binding 1x3 cells to 3x2 cells cannot work because it is unknown which 3 cells of the original 6 cells should be used.
* You cannot change the cell range of an existing binding. You must first unbind the cells and then create a new binding.
* The frame color indicating the binding cannot be changed yet.
