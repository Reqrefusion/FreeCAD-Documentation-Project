This is the place to come if you are an experienced user and want to learn more about customizing and extending FreeCAD.

<!--T:4-->
FreeCAD is extensible by [[Python|Python]] code that is run directly in the [[Python_console|Python console]], or that is loaded from modules at startup. This means that you can modify FreeCAD without needing to recompile the program. For example, you can:
* '''Create and modify geometry''': you can create a new object type, either from scratch or by adapting an existing type.
* '''Create custom tools and commands''': add your own set of tools that run your code.
* '''Modify the interface''': create toolbars to put your tools, create special windows, panels, or interfaces for interacting with your tools.
*'''Modify the scenegraph representation''': FreeCAD has separate processes for building up the geometry and displaying that geometry on screen. You have full access to the way the scene contents are displayed on screen, therefore you can modify that representation, interact with it, or add custom behaviour to it. You can also add custom screen widgets, like information, draggers, anchors or temporary entities.

=== Modules === <!--T:28-->

<!--T:29-->
The functionality of FreeCAD is separated in Modules which deal with special data types and applications. FreeCAD has built-in modules and Extension Modules (plug-ins). Once plugin modules are installed, they become availible to you as easily as the built-in modules. The modules described below are the default modules, includeed in every FreeCAD installation.

<!--T:30-->
* The [[Builtin modules|Builtin modules]] are the principal FreeCAD modules. They contain tools for manipulating general FreeCAD configurations, documents and their contents.
* [[Workbench creation|Workbench creation]] shows you how to create your own workbench

* [[FreeCAD vector math library|FreeCAD vector math library]] : A couple of handy functions to manipulate FreeCAD vectors. This library is also included in the Draft module.

== API Functions == <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
The complete API documentation of FreeCAD is located at https://freecad.org/api/ . It contains both C++ and Python APIs, and is not totally well formatted yet, which can be confusing when looking for python-only code. An easier to browse version can be found [[:Category:API|here]]. Note that it can be incomplete, since it is updated manually. For more accurate information, browse the modules directly from FreeCAD's Python console.
