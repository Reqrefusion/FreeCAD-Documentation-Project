==Introduction==

[[Image:Design456_workbench_icon.svg|thumb|128px|Design456 External workbench icon]]
{{TOCright}}

The Design456 workbench is an [[External_workbenches|External workbench]] that plans to implement a Direct Modeling methodology in FreeCAD. Think 'push and pull geometry' that one finds in CAD suites like SketchUp and Fusion360.

The original idea came to live when the developer of Design456 wanted to do the basic tasks which is simple and easy to do in 123D Design. FreeCAD could do the same job but the tools aren't interfaced in that way. This workbench will not keep track of old shapes. It tries to clean up the garbage which might be produced during running under commands. It tries to make the tree as simple as possible. Parameters must be decided during the desired manipulations which cannot be changed later.

This Wikipage is not updated regularly. To get the latest tool-list, you need to look at Design456 github or youtube videos. Only one developer is working on this project, and time to update these all documents is missing unfortunately.

==Background==

Traditionally, FreeCAD employs a Parametric Modeling methodology which is a powerful and scalable approach. It is also has been an industry standard. But I wish to have another approach. My workbench will try to implement direct modeling which is not provided at the moment by FreeCAD.

==Important note==

Please notice that there is no released version yet for this workbench. Intensively development is ongoing and bug is expected for the tools. Don't use it on serious document yet. Make a copy of you object and apply my tools. By that you know if it works for you or not without taking risk.

==Installation==

Download the Design456 workbench via the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px|link=Std_AddonMgr]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] {{MenuCommand|Tools â†’ Addon Manager}}

If the above is not working for you please consider :
* Addon manager no longer works in FreeCAD 0.18 due to changes in Github use FreeCAD 0.20 instead.
* Invoke the Addon Manager - Tools | Adddon manager.
* Select Configure..Into Custom repositories enter https://github.com/MariwanJ/Design456.
* Then OK.
* Restart FreeCAD.

* Smart Fillet
* Smart Chamfer
* Smart Extrude
* Smart Extrude Rotate
* Smart Edge Extend

==FreeCAD GUI Widgets toolkit==

[[FreeCAD GUI Widgets toolkit|FreeCAD GUI Widgets toolkit]] is a work for providing easy to use Coin3D drawing GUI toolkit. The toolkit will make it easy to draw and should provide an interactive way to manipulate FreeCAD e objects. The simplicity of the toolkit should make it easy to use it.

Widgets gives you the ability to get callbacks, and are inspired by the well known multi-platform toolkit www.fltk.org. Almost all smart tools must have a widget from this toolkit.

==Defeaturing Workbench added to Design456==

I added the workbench to my workbench and further development of the tools will continue. It was necessary to add the de-featuring tools to Design456. More tools must be added to the tool set in the feature.

*To be continued!

==Microelly2 Tools (Nurbs Workbench) converted==

I did the conversion for the Nurbs and fixed many bugs. In the beginning I added the project to my workbench, but since the tools are not working well, I remove it. The work is huge and there were places where I didn't know how to solve the issues. More time required and more understanding of Microlley's work is required that is why the work on the project is suspended. Some good works are done and you can find the project at: [https://github.com/MariwanJ/nurbs Github Nurb]. Unfortunately, the code is more experimental code that is not made to be a tool in a workbench. Due to that, I wasn't able to retrieve all tools and it is hard to understand the tools. Most of the code are undocumented. There are good things there but not structured in a way a workbench requires.

Note: Due to what I described, further developing Nurbs workbench is not possible, at least for now.
