==Introduction== <!--T:67-->

<!--T:1-->
The preferences for the [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] can be found in the [[Preferences Editor|Preferences Editor]]. In the menu select {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences}} and then {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|16px]] Sketcher}}. This group is only available if the Sketcher Workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

<!--T:23-->
There are four pages: [[#General|General]], [[#Grid|Grid]], [[#Display|Display]] and [[#Appearance|Appearance]].

<!--T:68-->
Some advanced preferences can only be changed in the [[Std_DlgParameter|Parameter editor]]. See [[Fine-tuning#Sketcher_Workbench|Fine-tuning]].

<!--T:52-->
This page has been updated for version 1.0.

<!--T:53-->
In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the [[#Appearance|Appearance]] page is labeled "Colors".

==General== <!--T:24-->

<!--T:43-->
On this page you can specify the following:

<!--T:27-->
{| class="wikitable float-right mw-collapsible mw-uncollapsed"
!style="width: 33%;"|Name
!style="width: 66%;"|Description
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Show section 'Advanced Solver Controls'}}
| If checked, the [[Sketcher_Dialog|sketcher dialog]] will show the section ''Advanced Solver Controls''  to adjust solver settings.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Improve solving while dragging}}
| If checked, a special solver algorithm will be used while dragging sketch elements. This avoids that the sketch flips around while dragging. It is an improvement for most cases, however for complex sketches this option can increase the time to solve the sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Auto remove redundant constraints}}
| If checked, new constraints that are redundant are automatically removed.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Esc key can leave sketch edit mode}}
| If checked, the {{KEY|Esc}} key can trigger exiting sketch edit mode. The option to disable this may be useful for users who are used to pressing {{KEY|Esc}} as part of their workflow in other CAD solutions but don't necessarily want to exit a sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Disable shading in edit mode}} Only available in version 1.0.
| If checked, the shaded view is disabled when entering sketch edit mode.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Notify about automatic constraint substitutions}}
| If checked, you will be informed with a dialog about constraint substitutions. For example if the endpoints of two arcs are connected with the [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|coincident constraint]] and you reconnect the arcs using the [[Sketcher_ConstrainTangent|tangent constraint]], the coincidence constraint will be substituted by the tangent constraint and you will get a popup dialog telling you this.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Unify coincident and point-on-object constraints}} {{Version|1.0}}
| If checked, the [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|coincident constraint tool]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|point-on-object constraint tool]] are unified in a [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified|single tool]].

<!--T:54-->
{{Emphasis|After changing this preference you must restart FreeCAD.}}

<!--T:55-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Unified tool for automatic horizontal/vertical constraints}} {{Version|1.0}}
| If checked, the [[Sketcher_ConstrainHorVer|automatic horizontal/vertical constraint tool]] is added to the toolbar (it is always available in the menu and through its shortcut), and the [[Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal|horizontal constraint tool]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainVertical|vertical constraint tool]] are grouped below it in a dropdown.

<!--T:56-->
{{Emphasis|After changing this preference you must restart FreeCAD.}}

<!--T:71-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Group the polyline and line commands}} {{Version|1.1}}
| If checked, a command group button that contains both the [[Sketcher_CreatePolyline|polyline]] and [[Sketcher_CreateLine|line]] commands is shown. Otherwise, each command has its own separate button.

<!--T:72-->
{{Emphasis|After changing this preference you must restart FreeCAD.}}

<!--T:70-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Always add external geometry as construction}} {{Version|1.1}}
| If checked, [[Sketcher_External|external geometry]] is always added as construction geometry regardless of the current [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction mode]].

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Generate internal faces}} {{Version|1.1}}
| If checked, closed loops will automatically generate internal faces which are selectable to be used with other tools.

<!--T:57-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Dimensioning constraints}} {{Version|1.0}}
| Specifies the dimensional constraint tools for the toolbar (all dimensional tools are always available in the menu and through their shortcuts). The options are:
* {{MenuCommand|Single tool}}: A combined [[Sketcher_Dimension|Dimension tool]] for all dimensional constraints. The separate tools are grouped below it in a dropdown.
* {{MenuCommand|Separated tools}}: Only the separate tools.
* {{MenuCommand|Both}}: Both the combined [[Sketcher_Dimension|Dimension tool]] and the separated tools.

<!--T:58-->
{{Emphasis|After changing this preference you must restart FreeCAD.}}

<!--T:59-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Dimension tool diameter/radius mode}} {{Version|1.0}}
| Specifies how the combined [[Sketcher_Dimension|Dimension tool]] handles circles and arcs. Disabled if the previous preference is set to {{MenuCommand|Separated tools}}. The options are:
* {{MenuCommand|Auto}}: First apply a radius dimension to arcs and a diameter dimension to circles. Before picking the point that will position the dimension, it is possible to switch with the {{KEY|M}} key.
* {{MenuCommand|Diameter}}: Always first apply a diameter dimension. Idem.
* {{MenuCommand|Radius}}: Always first apply a radius dimension. Idem.

<!--T:73-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Scale upon first constraint}} {{Version|1.1}}
| Specifies how automatic geometry scaling upon first dimension is performed:
* {{MenuCommand|Always}}: Automatic scaling upon first dimension is always performed.
* {{MenuCommand|Never}}: Automatic scaling upon first dimension is never performed.
* {{MenuCommand|When no scale feature is visible}}: Automatic scaling upon first dimension is only performed if there are no visible objects in the 3D View.

<!--T:60-->
|-
| {{MenuCommand|On-view-parameters (OVP)}} {{Version|1.0}}
| Specifies the visibility mode for the On-view-parameters. The options are:
* {{MenuCommand|None}}: On-View-Parameters are completely disabled.
* {{MenuCommand|Dimensions only}}: Only dimensional On-view-parameters are enabled. They are the most useful. For example the radius of a circle.
* {{MenuCommand|Position and dimensions}}: Both positional and dimensional On-view-parameters are enabled. Positional parameters are the position of the cursor. For example for the center of a circle.

<!--T:45-->
On this page you can specify the following:

<!--T:46-->
{| class="wikitable float-right mw-collapsible mw-uncollapsed"
!style="width: 33%;"|Name
!style="width: 66%;"|Description
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Grid}}
| If checked, a grid will be shown while the sketch is in edit mode. Used for new sketches. Is stored in the {{PropertyView|Show Grid}} property of sketches.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Grid auto-spacing}}
| If checked, grid spacing is automatically adapted based on the view dimensions. Used for new sketches. Is stored in the {{PropertyView|Grid Auto}} property of sketches.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Grid spacing}}

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Pixel size threshold}}
| The grid spacing threshold in pixels. Only used if {{MenuCommand|Grid auto-spacing}} is enabled. If the onscreen spacing is smaller than this value, physical grid spacing is multiplied by the {{MenuCommand|Major grid line interval}} value. If the onscreen spacing is larger than the threshold value times the {{MenuCommand|interval}} value, physical grid spacing is divided by the {{MenuCommand|interval}} value. If the {{MenuCommand|interval}} value is set to 1, 10 is used instead in these calculations.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Minor Grid Lines}}
| For minor grid lines you can specify:
* {{MenuCommand|Line pattern}}
* {{MenuCommand|Line width}}
* {{MenuCommand|Line color}}
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Major Grid Lines}}
| For major grid lines you can specify:
* {{MenuCommand|Major grid line interval}}: The number of squares between major grid lines. Set to 1 to disable major grid lines.
* {{MenuCommand|Line pattern}}

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Segments per geometry}}
|  Curves are approximated by polygon segments for visualization. This value defines the number of segments. The lower limit is 50 segments. Higher values refine the visualization but can lead to longer calculation times, especially for [[Sketcher_CreateBSpline|B-splines]].
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Ask for value after creating a dimensional constraint}}
|  If checked, a dialog will pop up to input a value for new dimensional constraints.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Geometry creation "Continue Mode"}}
|  If checked, geometry creation tools will remain active after creating an element. You can leave a tool any time by right-clicking in the sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Constraint creation "Continue Mode"}}
|  If checked, constraint creation tools will remain active after creating a constraint. You can leave a tool any time by right-clicking in the sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Hide base length units for supported unit systems}}
|  If checked, the length unit from the selected [[Preferences_Editor#Units|unit system]] is used but not displayed in sketch constraints. Only for supported unit systems.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Show coordinates beside cursor while editing}} {{Version|0.21}}
| If checked, cursor coordinates are displayed beside the cursor while editing a sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Use system decimals setting for cursor coordinates}} {{Version|0.21}}

* {{MenuCommand|%N}}: Parameter name.
* {{MenuCommand|%V}}: Dimension value.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Hide all objects that depend on the sketch}}
|  If checked, all objects that depend on the sketch will be hidden when the sketch is opened. Note that this may have no effect if the {{MenuCommand|Show objects used for external geometry}} and/or {{MenuCommand|Show objects that the sketch is attached to}} options are selected.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Show objects used for external geometry}}
|  If checked, hidden objects used for external geometry will be shown when the sketch is opened.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Show objects that the sketch is attached to}}
|  If checked, hidden objects the sketch is attached to will be shown when the sketch is opened.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Restore camera position after editing}}
|  If checked, the camera position is moved back to where it was before the sketch was opened.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Force orthographic camera when entering edit}}
|  If checked, camera mode will be forced to orthographic when the sketch is opened. Camera mode will be restored when leaving edit mode. This preference is only available if {{MenuCommand|Restore camera position after editing}} is activated.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Open sketch in Section View mode}}
|  If checked, the sketch will open with 'Section View' active.
|-
| {{Button|{{MenuCommand|Apply to existing sketches}}}}

==Appearance== <!--T:64-->

<!--T:65-->
[[Image:Preferences_Sketcher_Page_Appearance.png|400px]]

<!--T:66-->
Unless otherwise stated these preferences are only used while a sketch is in edit mode.

<!--T:49-->

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Colors outside Sketcher: Edge}}
| The color used for [[Glossary#Edge|edges]] when not in edit mode.
|}

<!--T:35-->
The colors for selections while a sketch is in edit mode are controlled by the global settings {{MenuCommand|Enable preselection highlighting}} and {{MenuCommand|Enable selection highlighting}}, see the [[Preferences_Editor#Selection|Preferences Editor]].

<!--T:69-->
The size of the vertices in edit mode is controlled by the {{MenuCommand|Marker size}} [[Preferences_Editor#3D_View|setting]].

==Note== <!--T:36-->

<!--T:37-->
There is another preference that has an influence on sketches. If the {{MenuCommand|Transparent objects}} preference on the [[Preferences_Editor#3D_View|Display → 3D View]] tab is set to {{Value|Backface pass}}, arrowheads on one end of sketch dimensions are hidden on some systems. When viewed from the rear the dimension value can then also be hidden. Versions 0.19 to 0.21 (except Link branch) are affected. In versions 0.19 and 0.20 the effect only occurs if {{MenuCommand|Show grid}} is deactivated in the [[Sketcher_Dialog#Edit_controls|Edit controls]] section of the [[Task_panel|Task panel]] as shown below.
