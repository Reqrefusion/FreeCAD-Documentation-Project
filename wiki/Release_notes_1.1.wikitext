== Core system and API == <!--T:10-->

=== Core === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:64-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Core_datums_relnotes_1.1.png|384px]]
| [[Std_Base#Part_Datums|Core Datum tools]] were implemented to create coordinate systems, datum planes, datum lines and datum points which can be attached and also used in Assembly.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18332 Pull request #18332]

<!--T:65-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Std_Transform_Manip_relnotes_1.1.gif|384px]]</br>Click on the image if the animation does not start.
| The [[Std TransformManip|Transform]] tool was overhauled and now allows for precise inputs besides dragging in the 3D view. It is possible to align the interactive dragger to any element in the document and to transform the object in that local (U, V, W) coordinate system of the dragger, or in the global document coordinate system. The dragger can be aligned to the object's origin as before, and also to the center of mass of the object. It has a new feature to move the object (at the location of the dragger) to a target location in the document and flip the orientation. See all [[Std_TransformManip#Options|new options]].

* It is now possible to directly use external geometry as input for tools like offset or transform (array), for both external construction and defining geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17615 Pull request #17615]
* External geometry (projected or intersecting) is now by default real (defining) geometry (which does not need to be traced as in 1.0 and prior). It can be toggled to construction geometry as any other geometry [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17736 Pull request #17736]
* The Sketcher axes are now displayed with infinite length. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17312 Pull request #17312]
* Sketches are now ordered alphabetically in the [[Sketcher_MapSketch|Attach sketch]] dialog. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16518 Pull request #16518]
* Group dragging was added, making it possible to drag all the selected geometrical entities. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18273 Pull request #18273]
* There is a new preference that, if checked, makes external geometry creation independent of the current construction mode - it is always created as reference geometry in such a case. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18697 Pull request #18697]
* A preference was added to allow optional grouping of the [[Sketcher_CreateLine|Line]] and [[Sketcher_CreatePolyline|Polyline]] tools. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20165 Pull request #20165]
* When selecting a constraint or a geometry element within the sketch, the corresponding Tasks panel list is now automatically scrolled to that object. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18859 Pull request #18859] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20866 Pull request #20866]

== Spreadsheet Workbench == <!--T:42-->

=== Further Spreadsheet improvements === <!--T:43-->

<!--T:54-->
* Default shortcuts for [[Spreadsheet_StyleBold|Bold text]], [[Spreadsheet_StyleItalic|Italic text]] and [[Spreadsheet_StyleUnderline|Underline text]] have been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15556 Pull request #15556]
* Double-clicking on the separator in the header now resizes the column to content. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16296 Pull request #16296]
* Zoom was added to Spreadsheet. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16130 Pull request #16130]

=== Further Surface improvements === <!--T:45-->

== TechDraw Workbench == <!--T:46-->

=== Further TechDraw improvements === <!--T:47-->

<!--T:62-->
* The [[TechDraw_AreaDimension|Insert Area Annotation]] tool now properly accounts for holes in faces. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17740 Pull request #17740]
* Shape validation is now available and can be enabled in [[TechDraw_Preferences#Advanced|Preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18282 Pull request #18282]
* Scaling of SVG symbols has been fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18757 Pull request #18757]
* New ''r'' format specifier was added. It rounds the dimension value to the step specified as decimal before ''r''. For example, ''%0.5r'' (or just ''%.5r'') rounds to 0.5. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19393 Pull request #19393]

== Import and export == <!--T:77-->

<!--T:78-->
* The alignment of sketches in SVG export and legacy DXF export has been fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19765 Pull request #19765]
