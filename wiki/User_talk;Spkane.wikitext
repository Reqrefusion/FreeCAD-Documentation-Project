== Why do you make things unnecessarily hard? ==

Hi. You have reverted some of my edits to your pages and have thereby undone some of my fixes. That is NOT a good idea. Also do not play around with translation unit tags. They are added automatically. And once they are in place they should not be renumbered. That messes up the work of translators.
