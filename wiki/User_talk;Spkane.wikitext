== Why do you make things unnecessarily hard? ==

Hi. You have reverted some of my edits to your pages and have thereby undone some of my fixes. That is NOT a good idea. Also do not play around with translation unit tags. They are added automatically. And once they are in place they should not be renumbered. That messes up the work of translators.

:You should not replace the content of a Wiki page with the pasted content of a local file. That is probable the cause of this problem. I have reverted your changes to the [[Robust_MCP_Bridge_Workbench]] page. Please do not reintroduce the <nowiki>{{Workbench ...}}</nowiki> template. It does not exist. I have tried to reapply your edits to your macro pages. But please check that. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 12:36, 13 January 2026 (UTC)
::I have also updated [[Robust_MCP_Bridge_Workbench]] now. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 15:10, 14 January 2026 (UTC)
