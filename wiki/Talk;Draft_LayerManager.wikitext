Here is my attempt at a draft of how to use BIM Layers

==Usage==

Layers are an organizational tool. The layers implementation the BIM workbench offers options to control several properties of your objects:
* Graphical appearance
* Layer properties for export to vector formats like [[DXF]] & [FreeCAD_and_DWG_Import|DWG]]
* [[NativeIFC]] properties

BIM layers are not activated by default in a new file.

Use the [[File:Draft_tray_button_layer.png|px16]]'''[[Draft_AutoGroup|Autogroup]]''' button from the '''[[Draft_Tray]]''' to enable layers.

Use the [[File:Draft_LayerManager.svg|16px]]'''[[Draft_LayerManager|Layer Manager]]''' button from the '''Manage Toolbar''' to edit layer properties.

Because usage of '''[[BIM_Layers]]''' is almost identical to '''[[Draft_Layer|Draft Layers]]''', that documentation is useful for '''[[BIM_Workbench]]''' users, it is not duplicated here.

Unique to '''[[BIM Layers]]''' are options for managing [[NativeIFC]] properties. This is a work in progress. Users can read [https://yorik.uncreated.net/?blog%2Ffreecad Yorik's blog] for updates from a lead developer of NativeIFC functionality in FreeCAD.
