----

This template creates a caption underneath a left aligned image. It uses the <code>text-align:left</code> HTML property inside paragraph tags <nowiki><p></p></nowiki>. A carriage return is automatically added.

The advantage of not placing the caption within the image code is that the image can then be removed from translation by placing <nowiki></translation><translation></nowiki> tags around it. In the translation interface only the caption needs to be translated.

== Left aligned ==

Example:

 <nowiki>
[[File:Freecad.svg]]
{{Caption|The image above shows the FreeCAD logo. This is a very long caption that should wrap-around itself after a certain width, in order for it to be more readable. Images should be probably a maximum of 800 px wide.}}

This is a normal paragraph.</nowiki>

Result:

[[File:Freecad.svg]]
{{Caption|The image above shows the FreeCAD logo. This is a very long caption that should wrap-around itself after a certain width, in order for it to be more readable. Images should be probably a maximum of 800 px wide.}}

This is a normal paragraph.

== Center aligned ==
For center-aligned captions, use the <code>align=center</code> option.

Example:

 <nowiki>
[[File:Freecad.svg|center]]
{{Caption|align=center|The image above shows the FreeCAD logo. This is a very long caption that should wrap-around itself after a certain width, in order for it to be more readable. Images should be probably a maximum of 800 px wide.}}

This is a normal paragraph.</nowiki>

[[File:Freecad.svg|center]]
{{Caption|align=center|The image above shows the FreeCAD logo. This is a very long caption that should wrap-around itself after a certain width, in order for it to be more readable. Images should be probably a maximum of 800 px wide.}}

This is a normal paragraph.
