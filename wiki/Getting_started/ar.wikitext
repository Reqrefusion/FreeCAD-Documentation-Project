== مقدمة ==

برنامج FreeCAD هو [[About_FreeCAD|تطبيق للنمذجة ثلاثية الأبعاد بارامتري]]. صُمم البرنامج بشكل أساسي للتصميم الميكانيكي، ولكنه يخدم أيضاً جميع الاستخدامات الأخرى التي تحتاج فيها إلى نمذجة أجسام ثلاثية الأبعاد بدقة وتحكم في سجل النمذجة.

يخضع FreeCAD للتطوير منذ عام 2002، وهو يوفر قائمة كبيرة من [[Feature_list|المميزات]]. لا تزال هناك بعض القدرات المفقودة، ولكنه قوي بما يكفي لاستخدام الهواة والورش الصغيرة. هناك مجتمع متنامٍ بسرعة من المستخدمين المتحمسين الذين يشاركون في [https://forum.freecad.org منتدى FreeCAD]، ويمكنك أن تجد هناك [https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=24 العديد من الأمثلة] لمشاريع عالية الجودة تم تطويرها باستخدام FreeCAD.

مثل جميع مشاريع البرمجيات الحرة، يعتمد FreeCAD على مجتمعه للنمو، واكتساب المميزات، وإصلاح الأخطاء. لا تنسَ هذا عند استخدام FreeCAD؛ إذا أعجبك البرنامج، يمكنك [[Donate|التبرع]] و [[Help_FreeCAD|مساعدة FreeCAD]] بطرق متنوعة، مثل كتابة التوثيق وإجراء الترجمات.

==Installing==
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
First of all, download and install FreeCAD. See the [[Download|Download]] page for information on current versions and updates, and the installation instructions for you operating system ([[Installing_on_Windows|Windows]], [[Installing_on_Linux|Linux]] or [[Installing_on_Mac|macOS]]). FreeCAD is available from the package managers of many Linux distributions. As FreeCAD is open-source, you can also grab the source code and [[Compiling|compile]] it yourself.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The main concept behind the FreeCAD interface is that it is separated into [[workbenches|workbenches]]. A workbench is a collection of tools suited for a specific task, such as working with [[Mesh_Workbench|meshes]], or drawing [[Draft_Workbench|2D objects]], or [[Sketcher_Workbench|constrained sketches]]. You can switch the current workbench with the [[Std_Workbench|workbench selector]]. You can [[Interface_Customization|customize]] the tools included in each workbench, add tools from other workbenches or even self-created tools, that we call [[macros|macros]]. Widely used starting points are the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] and [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
When you start FreeCAD for the first time, you are presented with the Start page. Here is what it looks like for version 0.19:
</div>

[[File:Start_center_0.19_screenshot.png|600px]]
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The Start page allows you to quickly jump to one of the most common workbenches, open one of the recent files, or see the latest news from the FreeCAD world. You can change the default workbench in the [[Preferences_Editor|preferences]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Navigating in the 3D space ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD has several [[Mouse_navigation|navigation modes]] available, that change the way you use your mouse to interact with the objects in the 3D view and the view itself. One of them is specifically made for [[Mouse_navigation#Touchpad_navigation|touchpads]], where the middle mouse button is not used. The default navigation mode is [[Mouse_navigation#CAD_navigation|CAD navigation]]. You can quickly change the current navigation mode by using the {{Button|[[File:NavigationCAD_dark.svg|16px]]}} button in the [[Status_bar|Status bar]] or by right-clicking an empty area of the [[3D_view|3D view]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
You also have several view presets (top view, front view, etc) available in the View menu, on the View toolbar, and by numeric shortcuts ({{KEY|1}}, {{KEY|2}}, etc...).  By right-clicking on an object or on an empty area of the 3D view, you have quick access to some common operations, such as setting a particular view, or locating an object in the Tree view.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==First steps with FreeCAD==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
FreeCAD's focus is to allow you to make high-precision 3D models, to keep tight control over those models (being able to go back into modelling history and change parameters), and eventually to build those models (via 3D printing, CNC machining or even construction worksite). It is therefore very different from some other 3D applications made for other purposes, such as animation film or gaming. Its learning curve can be steep, especially if this is your first contact with 3D modeling. If you are stuck at some point, don't forget that the friendly community of users on the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum] might be able to get you out in no time.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The workbench you will start using in FreeCAD depends on the type of job you need to do: If you are going to work on mechanical models, or more generally any small-scale objects, you'll probably want to try the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. If you will work in 2D, then switch to the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], or the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] if you need constraints. If you want to do BIM, launch the [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]]. And if you come from the OpenSCAD world, try the [[OpenSCAD_Workbench|OpenSCAD Workbench]]. There are also many community-developed [[External_workbenches|external workbenches]] available.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
You can switch workbenches at any time, and also [[Interface_Customization|customize]] your favorite workbench to add tools from other workbenches.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Working with the PartDesign and Sketcher workbenches==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] is made to build complex objects, starting from simple shapes, and adding or removing pieces (called "features"), until you get to your final object. All the features you applied during the modelling process are stored in a separate view called the [[Document_structure|tree view]], which also contains the other objects in your document. You can think of a PartDesign object as a succession of operations, each one applied to the result of the preceding one, forming one big chain. In the tree view, you see your final object, but you can expand it and retrieve all preceding states, and change any of their parameter, which automatically updates the final object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The PartDesign workbench makes heavy use of another workbench, the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. The sketcher allows you to draw 2D shapes, which are defined by applying Constraints to the 2D shape. For example, you might draw a rectangle and set the size of a side by applying a length constraint to one of the sides. That side then cannot be resized anymore (unless the constraint is changed).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Those 2D shapes made with the sketcher are used a lot in the PartDesign workbench, for example to create 3D volumes, or to draw areas on the faces of your object that will then be hollowed from its main volume. This is a typical PartDesign workflow:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Create a new sketch
# Draw a closed shape (make sure all points are joined)
# Close the sketch
# Expand the sketch into a 3D solid by using the pad tool
# Select one face of the solid
# Create a second sketch (this time it will be drawn on the selected face)
# Draw a closed shape
# Close the sketch
# Create a pocket from the second sketch, on the first object
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Which gives you an object like this:
</div>

[[Image:Partdesign_example.jpg|600px]]

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
At any moment, you can select the original sketches and modify them, or change the extrusion parameters of the pad or pocket operations, which will update the final object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Working with the Draft and BIM workbenches==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] and [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] behave a bit differently than the other workbenches above, although they follow the same rules, which are common to all of FreeCAD. In short, while the Sketcher and PartDesign are made primarily to design single pieces, Draft and BIM are made to ease your work when working with several, simpler objects.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] offers you 2D tools somewhat similar to what you can find in traditional 2D CAD applications such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD AutoCAD]. However, 2D drafting being far away from the scope of FreeCAD, don't expect to find there the full array of tools that these dedicated applications offer. Most of the Draft tools work not only in a 2D plane but also in the full 3D space, and benefit from special helper systems such as [[Draft_SelectPlane|Work planes]] and [[Draft_Snap|object snapping]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] adds [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Information_Modeling BIM] tools to FreeCAD, allowing you to build architectural models with parametric objects. The BIM workbench relies extensively on other modules such as Draft and Sketcher. All the Draft tools are also present in the BIM workbench, and most BIM tools make use of the Draft helper systems.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A typical workflow with BIM and Draft workbenches might be:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Draw a couple of lines with the Draft Line tool
# Select each line and press the Wall tool to build a wall on each of them
# Join the walls by selecting them and pressing the BIM Add tool
# Create a floor object, and in the Tree view drag your walls into the floor object
# Create a building object, and in the Tree view drag your floor (which now includes the walls) into the building object
# Create a window by clicking the Window tool, select a preset in its panel, then click on a face of a wall
# Add dimensions by first setting the working plane if necessary, then using the Draft Dimension tool
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Which will give you this:

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Addons==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Any user can develop their own new features for FreeCAD and make them available to the FreeCAD community as an [[Addon|addon]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
There are three types of addons:
* [[Macros|Macros]]: short snippet of [[Python|Python]] code that provides a new tool or functionality in a single file ending with {{incode|.FCMacro}}.
* [[External_workbenches|Workbenches]]: collections of Python files that provide related [[Gui_Command|Gui Commands]] (tools) centered around a particular topic.
* [[Preference_Packs|Preference Packs]]: distributable collections of user preferences.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Scripting==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
And finally, one of the most powerful features of FreeCAD is the [[Power_users_hub#Scripting_in_FreeCAD|scripting]] environment. From the integrated python console (or from any other external Python script), you can gain access to almost any part of FreeCAD, create or modify geometry, modify the representation of those objects in the 3D scene or access and modify the FreeCAD interface. Python scripting can also be used in [[macros|macros]], which provide an easy method to create custom commands.
