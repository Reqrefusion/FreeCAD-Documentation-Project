==Beschreibung==

This calculator determines the parachute size required to achieve the desired descent rate based on the parachute parameters.

The desired descent rate depends on your needs. As a rule of thumb, the main parachute should slow the rocket to approximately <math>6.1\,m/s\,(20\,f/s)</math> while the drone should allow the parachute to descend much faster
<math>18.3\,m/s\,(60\,f/s)</math> - <math>21.3\,m/s\,(70\,f/s)</math>. The editor has presets for these, with the value for the drogue being in the middle of the range. You can set a custom descent rate to suit your needs.

A key value for determining the descent rate is the coefficient of drag (<math>C_D</math>). The exact value of this will depend on a variety of factors including the shape of the parachute. Presets are provided for parachutes cut from a flat piece of material (round, square, hexagonal) such as those provided by many kits, and for a true dome shape. Your parachute manufacturer may provide a better value for this coefficient.

# There are several ways to invoke the command: 
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Rocket_Calculator.svg|16px]] [[Rocket_Parachute_Size_Calculator|Parachute Size Calculator]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Rocket → Calculators → [[Image:Rocket_Calculator.svg|16px]] Parachute Size Calculator}} option from the menu.
# Enter the weight of your rocket and parameters for your parachute.

==Berechnung==

Parachute size is determined by the mass of the rocket, desired descent rate, and drag characteristics of the parachute. The calculation is a two step process. First the area of the parachute is calculated:

::<math>A = { 2mg \over { \rho v_T^2 C_D }}</math>

where

::<math>m = </math> the mass of the rocket
::<math>v_T = </math> desired terminal velocity
::<math>C_D = </math> drag coefficient of the parachute
::<math>\rho = 1.22</math> air density, average at sea level in <math>kg/m^3</math> at <math>15C</math>
::<math>g = 9.807</math> acceleration due to gravity in <math>m/s^2</math>

The diameter is then calculated from the surface area based on the shape.

For hexagonal parachutes:

::<math>D = \sqrt{ 2A \over sqrt{3}}</math>

For square parachutes, the diameter is the length of each side

::<math>D = \sqrt{A}</math>

For all other parachutes, the shape is assumed to be circular

::<math>D = \sqrt{ 4A \over \pi }</math>

===Einheiten===

Calculations are done using metric units, but will display in your preferred units. Values can also be entered using any supported units by including the units with the value (''eg'' 5 oz, or 23.2 g)
