==Beschreibung==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[Image:Cables_AttachInPlace.svg|24px]] [[Cables_AttachInPlace|Attach In Place]] makes an [[Part_EditAttachment| attachment]] of an object without changing its global position. The '''Map Mode''' property of an attached object is set to {{Value|Object XY}}, the '''Attacher Engine''' is set to {{Value|Engine 3D}}. The '''Attachment Offset''' property is calculated automatically.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This is useful when, for example, there are two objects that already have final distance and rotation between them and one of them has to be moved to a new place. This tool allows to build attachment keeping the distance and rotation between these objects untouched. Once the connection is established, moving the base object will not change the relative position of the attached object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In practice it can be used e.g. to make quick attachment of [[Cables_ElectricalDevice|Electrical Device]] to [[Cables_CableBox|Cable Box]], [[Cables_CableBox|Cable Box]] to the [[Arch_Wall|Arch Wall]], [[Cables_CableConnector|Cable Connector]] to any own PCB object or to another connector.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
It can be also used to make 'hooks' by attaching [[Cables_SupportPoint|Support Point]]s or [[Cables_SupportLine|Support Line]]s to the [[Arch_Wall|Arch Wall]] and create [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] upon them and then [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] from it. This would quickly make a cable fixed to the wall at certain points.

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Anwendung==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Select two or more objects in the [[3D_View|3D View]] or [[Tree_View|Tree View]] holding the {{KEY|CTRL}} key. The last selected object will be the '''Attachment Support''' for other selected objects.
# Create an [[Cables_AttachInPlace|Attach In Place]] attachment by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Cables_AttachInPlace.svg|16px]] [[Cables_AttachInPlace|Attach In Place]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Support → [[Image:Cables_AttachInPlace.svg|16px]] Attach In Place}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Support → [[Image:Cables_AttachInPlace.svg|16px]] Attach In Place}} option from the context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|X}} then {{KEY|A}}.
</div>

<span id="Notes"></span>
==Hinweise==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Selection of elements in [[3D_View|3D View]] is treated as a selection of entire objects. Attachment to object is understood as an attachment to its Placement.Base.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Due to long recompute time in some cases (e.g. if many complex objecst have been selected), the document is not recomputed automatically after [[Cables_AttachInPlace|Attach In Place]] command. The document can be [[Std_Refresh|recomputed]] manually e.g. by using the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|F5}} (or {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|R}}).
</div>
