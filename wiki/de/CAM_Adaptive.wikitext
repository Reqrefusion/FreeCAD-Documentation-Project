==Beschreibung==

The [[Image:CAM_Adaptive.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Adaptive|Adaptive]] operation algorithm creates clearing and profiling paths. The operation varies cutter engagement so that the material removal never exceeds a maximum value.

==Usage==

Usage instructions for the [[CAM_Adaptive|Adaptive]] operation are presented here.

===Basic Operation=== 

# Press the {{Button|[[Image:CAM_Adaptive.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Adaptive|Adaptive]]}} icon, or select the {{KEY|CAM}} → {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Adaptive.svg|24px]] [[CAM_Adaptive|Adaptive]]}} from the top menu.
# Select the tool controller for the Operation from the Tool controller dialogue pop up window, if prompted.
# Adjust the operation depths as needed in the Depths tab: Start Depth, Finish Depth, Step Down.
# Make adjustments in Heights tab if needed.
# Configure settings in the Operations tab:
## ('''See the [[#Properties|Properties]] → Adaptive section below.''')
## Set the Step Over value as a percentage of the diameter of the Tool.
# If you wish to preview the result before accepting the settings, click {{Button|Apply}}
# Click {{Button|OK}} button to confirm and generate paths.

===Preliminary Notes About Adaptive Clearing===

* Depending on the size and complexity of the area for the operation, is might be better to not recompute the operation after every property change; rather, consider:
** deactivate the operation with the {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_OpActiveToggle.svg|16px]] [[CAM_OpActiveToggle|Active]]}} toggle tool, make your changes to the operation's properties, then click the {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_OpActiveToggle.svg|16px]] [[CAM_OpActiveToggle|Active]]}} icon again to re-activate the operation - which triggers a recompute internally.
* The {{KEY|[[Image:CAM_Adaptive.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Adaptive|Adaptive]]}} operation might contain a few bugs yet to be clearly identified. Please report bugs and issues in the [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=15 FreeCAD Path/CAM Forum].
* All tool shapes may not be respected with this operation. Check the FreeCAD forum for further details. 
* Should you choose to run the path simulator in the CAM Workbench, it only uses the standard end mill to simulate paths. Therefore, you will not see tool-shape-specific material removal. Material removal is shown using the end mill shape.

==Properties==

''' ''Note'' ''': The names of some Properties in this list differ a little from the same settings used in the Task Window Editor.

{{TitleProperty|Adaptive}}

* {{PropertyData|Force Inside-Out}}: Force plunging into material inside and clearing towards the edges
* {{PropertyData|Helix Angle}}: Helix ramp entry angle (degrees)
* {{PropertyData|Helix Cone Angle}}: Angle (degrees) of conical helix
* {{PropertyData|Helix Diameter Limit}}: Limit helix entry diameter, if limit larger than tool diameter or 0, tool diameter is used
* {{PropertyData|Keep Tool Down Ratio}}: Max length of keep tool down path compared to direct distance between points
* {{PropertyData|Lift Distance}}: Lift distance for rapid moves
* {{PropertyData|Operation Type}}: Type of adaptive operation: Clearing or Profiling
* {{PropertyData|Side}}: Side of selected faces that tool should cut: Inside or Outside
* {{PropertyData|Step Over}}: Percent of cutter diameter to step over on each pass
* {{PropertyData|Stock to Leave}}: How much stock to leave (i.e. for a separate finishing operation)
* {{PropertyData|Tolerance}}: Influences accuracy and performance
* {{PropertyData|Use Helix Arcs}}: Use Arcs (G2) for helix ramp

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

Note: It is suggested that you do not edit the Placement property of path operations. Rather, move or rotate the CAM Job model as needed.

* {{PropertyData|Placement}}: Overall placement[position and rotation] of the object - with respect to the origin (or origin of parent object container)
** {{PropertyData|Angle}}: Angle in degrees applied to rotation of the object around Axis property value
** {{PropertyData|Axis}}:  Axis (one or multiple) around which to rotate the object, set in sub-properties: X, Y, Z
*** {{PropertyData|X}}: X axis value
*** {{PropertyData|Y}}: Y axis value
*** {{PropertyData|Z}}: Z axis value
** {{PropertyData|Position}}: Position of the object, set in sub-properties: X, Y, Z - with respect to the origin (or origin of parent object container)
*** {{PropertyData|X}}: X distance value
*** {{PropertyData|Y}}: Y distance value
*** {{PropertyData|Z}}: Z distance value
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: User-provided name of the object (UTF-8)

{{TitleProperty|Depth}}

* {{PropertyData|Clearance Height}}: The height needed to clear clamps and obstructions
* {{PropertyData|Final Depth}}: Final Depth of Tool- lowest value in Z
* {{PropertyData|Finish Depth}}: Maximum material removed on final pass.
* {{PropertyData|Safe Height}}: The above which Rapid motions are allowed.
* {{PropertyData|Start Depth}}: Starting Depth of Tool- first cut depth in Z
* {{PropertyData|Step Down}}: Incremental Step Down of Tool

{{TitleProperty|Path}}

* {{PropertyData|Active}}: Make False, to prevent operation from generating code
* {{PropertyData|Comment}}: An optional comment for this Operation
* {{PropertyData|Tool Controller}}: Defines the Tool controller used in the Operation
* {{PropertyData|User Label}}: User assigned label

==Tasks Window Editor Layout==

''Descriptions for these settings are provided in the Properties list above.''

This section is simply a layout map of the settings in the window editor for the Operation.

===Base Geometry===

* '''Add''': Adds selected element(s) which should be the base(s) for the path(s).
* '''Delete''': Delete the selected item(s) in the Base Geometry list.
* '''Clear''': Clear all items in the Base Geometry list.

===Depths===

* {{PropertyData|Start Depth}}
* {{PropertyData|Final Depth}}
* {{PropertyData|Finish Depth}}
* {{PropertyData|Step Down}}

===Heights===

* {{PropertyData|Safe Height}}
* {{PropertyData|Clearance Height}}

===Operation===

* {{PropertyData|Tool Controller}}
* {{PropertyData|Cut Region}} (Side)
* {{PropertyData|Operation Type}}
* {{PropertyData|Step Over Percent}}
* {{PropertyData|Accuracy vs Performance}} (Tolerance)
* {{PropertyData|Helix Ramp Angle}}
* {{PropertyData|Helix Cone Angle}}
* {{PropertyData|Helix Max Diameter}} (Helix Diameter Limit)
* {{PropertyData|Lift Distance}}
* {{PropertyData|Keep Tool Down Ratio}}
* {{PropertyData|Stock to Leave}}
* {{PropertyData|Force Clearing Inside-Out}}
* {{PropertyData|Stop}}

==Known Issues==

In case CAM Adaptive creates some unwanted paths, try with a {{PropertyData|Stock to Leave}} set to {{Value|0.001 mm}} or more. You can reduce the diameter of the tool by double that amount to keep the paths exact.

A proposed bugfix is available (but no one is working on integrating it):
