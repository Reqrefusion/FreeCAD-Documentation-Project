==Einleitung==

The [[File:FrontISTR.svg|24px]] FEM FrontISTR Workbench is a FreeCAD addon that enables FrontISTR, an open-source large-scale parallel FEM program for nonlinear structural analysis. 

[[File:FEM FrontISTR bikeframe screenshot.png|512px]]

=== Intended work-flow ===

# Set up an analysis model by FEM module (in the same way as CalculiX).
# Switch to the workbench '''FrontISTR''' and create a FrontISTR solver object by clicking on the toolbar button [[Image:FEM_SolverCalculixCxxtools.svg|24px]].
# Double-click on the solver object in the document tree and set the working directory.
# Click on the button '''Write input file'''
# Click on the button '''Run FrontISTR'''
# Check FISTR_Results for post-processing.

=== Features ===

* static analysis, element check
* geometrical linear|nonlinear analysis
* elements: 1st/2nd order tetrahedron
* loads: mechanical concentrated and distributed loads, gravity
* boundary: points fixed or displacement
* step control: auto time increment and cutback
* linear equation solver
** iterative
*** preconditioner: AMG, SSOR, Diagonal, ILU(k)(k=0,1,2)
*** method: CG, BiCGSTAB, GMRES, GPBiCG
** direct: MUMPS
* output file format: AVS, VTK (ParaView required)

=== Features to be supported in the future ===

* analysis: thermal transfer, dynamic, eigenfrequency
* materials(mechanical): elastoplastic, hyperelastic, creep, viscoelastic
* contact
* MPC(TIE)
* elements: prism, hexa, beam, shell, truss, etc.

=== Limitations ===

* FISTR_Results only contains results for surfaces. If you need the interior results, change the Output File Format to VTK and visualize the results with ParaView.
* The FEM FrontISTR workbench does not yet support thermal analyses. FISTR itself can perform thermal analyses and support for this is planned in the near future.
* Mechanical analyses with different materials in the model are not yet possible.

=== Benchmark results ===

See https://github.com/FrontISTR/FEM_FrontISTR/tree/master/sample/benchmarks.

== Installation ==

=== Addon Manager ===

FEM_FrontISTR can easily be installed via the FreeCAD [[Image:AddonManager.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] from the {{MenuCommand|Tools → Addon manager}} menu.
FEM_FrontISTR  is under active development and will get new features frequently. Therefore you should update it regularly using the menu {{MenuCommand|Tools → Addon manager}}.
The FEM_FrontISTR code is hosted and developed [https://github.com/FrontISTR/FEM_FrontISTR on GitHub].

=== Manual ===

See [[How_to_install_additional_workbenches|How to install additional workbenches]].

=== Prerequisites ===

* FreeCAD 0.19 or newer
* [https://www.paraview.org/ ParaView] (optional)

=== FrontISTR Solver Installation ===

FrontISTR binaries will be automatically downloaded and installed on the first run. If the download does not proceed, please follow the steps below to install the solver.

==== Windows ====

# Download [https://www.frontistr.com/download/link.php?https://frontistr-commons.gitlab.io/FrontISTR/release/x86_64-w64-mingw32-msmpi/FrontISTR-latest.zip FrontISTR-latest.zip]
# Create directory FEM_FrontISTR/bin
# Extract FrontISTR-latest.zip and put all files in FEM_FrontISTR/bin directory.

==== Linux ====

Under preparation.

==== Mac ====

Under preparation.

== Tools ==
