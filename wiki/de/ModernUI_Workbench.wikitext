== Einführung ==

The [[ModernUI_Workbench|ModernUI Workbench]] is an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] that replaces the standard user interface. It has modern features such as:
* Each workbench has its ribbon tab.
* '''Modern UI''' ribbon tab replaces the top-level menu.
* Activating a workbench's ribbon tab shows groups of the workbench's tools.
* Panels such as [[Combo_view|Combo View]] are collapsed/expanded upon mouse-over.

== Begrenzungen und Problembehebung ==

* If you experience unexpected behavior, always first try to uninstall and then reinstall the ModernUI workbench.
* The workbench is primarily tested with English and may exhibit unexpected behavior in other languages.
* Installing more workbenches after installing ModernUI may cause problems.

== Installieren ==

Install with the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px|link=Std_AddonMgr]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

Note: To uninstall, you have to create a macro and execute it. If you do not feel confident about this, consider to not install.

=== Running Modern UI in a self-contained directory ===

To easily test Modern UI without interfering with your standard configuration, you can contain it in a separate directory. Uninstalling Modern UI is then simply accomplished by deleting the directory. {{Version|0.19}}

==== Linux ====

Zum Beispiel:

<pre>
$ mkdir modernUI  # new directory that contains Modern UI
$ cd modernUI
$ HOME="$PWD" FREECAD_USER_HOME="$PWD" FreeCAD_0.19.AppImage
</pre>

When starting FreeCAD like this for the first time, you have a new default configuration. Now install (and configure) Modern UI. This is essentially a [[Download#Notes_for_GNU.2FLinux_users|''portable'' FreeCAD version]].

Instead of using the command line, you can also [[Start_up_and_Configuration#Starting_FreeCAD_from_the_desktop|create a dedicated desktop icon]].

==== Windows ====

There are not dedicated instructions for Windows yet, however, it is very similar to [[Start_up_and_Configuration#Starting_FreeCAD_from_a_portable_USB_medium|creating a portable version of FreeCAD on a USB medium]].

== Uninstall ==

Detailed instructions can be found on [https://github.com/HakanSeven12/Modern-UI#uninstallation GitHub].

The uninstall sequence is as follows:
# Uninstall with the [[Image:AddonManager.svg|24px|link=Std_AddonMgr]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].
# Restart FreeCAD.
# Create a macro with this code:{{Code|code=
from PySide2 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
mw = FreeCADGui.getMainWindow()
mw.menuBar().show()
 
WBList = FreeCADGui.listWorkbenches()
for WB in WBList:
    FreeCADGui.activateWorkbench(WB)
    for tb in mw.findChildren(QtWidgets.QToolBar):
        tb.show()
}}
# Führe das Makro aus.
# FreeCAD neu starten.
