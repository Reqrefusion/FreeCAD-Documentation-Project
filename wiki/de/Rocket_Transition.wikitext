==Beschreibung==

Transitions are like [[Rocket_NoseCone|nose cones]] in many ways. While typically conical, they can have the same shapes as nose cones, but are far more versatile.

The most common application is to change from one body diameter to another, such as between stages, or at the base of a payload fairing. It can also be used for a boat tail, where the diameter of the rocket decreases towards the exhaust nozzle.

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Anwendung==

# There are several ways to invoke the command: 
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Rocket_Transition.svg|16px]] [[Rocket_Transition|Transition]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Rocket → [[Image:Rocket_Transition.svg|16px]] Transition}} option from the menu.
#* Double click on a Transition object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# Set options and press {{Button|OK}}.

==Optionen==

<span id="Transition_Types"></span>
=== Übergangs-Typen ===

Transitions support all the shapes supported by Nose Cones, see [[Rocket_NoseCone#Options|Nose Cone Options]] for more details

<span id="Transition_Styles"></span>
===Übergangs-Stile===

Transitions support all the styles supported by Nose Cones, see [[Rocket_NoseCone#Options|Nose Cone Options]] for more details.

In addition, transitions have one more style option, ''Solid Core''. For this style, the transition is solid but with a hole from one end to another. One example where this might be used is a balsa transition designed to hold a body tube in the manner of a centering ring.

<span id="Clipped"></span>
===Abgeschnitten===

Shapes such as an ogive or a parabola can be applied in one of two ways. The standard, non-clipped, treats the axis parallel to the central axis offset by the smaller of the fore and aft radius as the axis for drawing the shape. The clipped method applies a larger version of the curve centered around the transition axis, and clips the portion forward of the smaller radius. In this example, the non-clipped curve is drawn from ''x=0'' to ''x=60'' around the ''y=10'' axis. The clipped version extends the shape along the x axis until ''y=0'' and takes only the portion from ''x=0'' to ''x=60''.<br>

For some shapes, this makes no difference in the shape of the transition, such as for conical or ogive shapes. In these cases, clipping is ignored.<br>

<span id="Notes"></span>
==Hinweise==

There are some known issues with the drawing of transitions that are currently being worked on.
* Clipped versions of elliptical transitions are producing invalid shapes
* Clipped versions where the forward radius is larger than the aft radius may produce invalid shapes. If this is the case you may design the transition backwards and use the Position to rotate it.
