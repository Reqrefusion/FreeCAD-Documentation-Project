|Description=When working with FreeCAD there are times when you want to quickly change the Drawstyle of the object you are working with. This is available through the Drawstyle pull-down menu where any Drawstyle may be selected. This macro makes 2 of the Drawstyles available as a clickable button on a toolbar which the user may click to toggle back and forth between the two Drawstyles. The user can modify the macro code to select which 2 Drawstyles they wish to toggle between. This does not add functionality missing in the Drawstyles pull-down menu, but rather an increased convenience level.

==Installation==

Installation is comprised of copying the two code to the appropriate Macro directory and invoking it from the Macro menu. It is much preferable to add it both to a toolbar so as to be more easily available.

{{MacroCode|code=
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#
#
#			Macro: Toggle Draw Style
#
# This macros allows the user to switch between different Drawstyles by clicking on
# the button of a Macro in a toolbar.
#
# initial code:		triplus
# macro-isation:	piffpoof
#
# This macro switches (or toggles) between 2 selected styles from the Drawstyle menu.
# As written the macro toggles between "WireFrame" and "As is".
# Immediately below this text is a list of the legal values for the Drawstyle menu.
# The first 2 lines of executable code are of the form "DrawstyleA = " followed by
# the 2nd line which is of the form "DrawstyleB = ".
# These 2 lines specify which of the Drawstyle values the macro will toggle between.
# Drawstyle "As is" is the system default and so is specified as the first drawstyle.
# The second line specifies which drawstyle will be toggled to and from.
# Any of the legal values may be used, so if, for example, it is desired to toggle between
# the Shaded and Points drawstyles, then the 2 lines of code would be modified to be:
#
# drawstyleA = "Shaded"
# drawstyleB = "Points"
#
# but remember that the hash signs ('#') are not to be present on the executable lines.
#
###Legal Values for Drawstyle###
#
# 0 = "As is"
# 1 = "Flat lines"
# 2 = "Shaded
# 3 = "Wireframe"
# 4 = "Points"
# 5 = "Hidden line"
# 6 = "No shading"
