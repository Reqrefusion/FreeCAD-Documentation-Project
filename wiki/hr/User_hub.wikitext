===Osnovna primjena===

* [[Interface|Interface]]: the FreeCAD interface is composed of various graphical elements on the screen, including the [[3D_view|3D view]], the [[Tree_view|tree view]], the [[Property_editor|property editor]], the [[Task_panel|task panel]], and the [[Python_console|Python console]].

* [[Import_Export|File formats]]: the different file formats that FreeCAD can read and write.

<span id="Workbenches"></span>
===Radni stolovi===

[[Workbenches|Workbenches]] are collections of tools used for specific tasks. These are the base workbenches bundled with every FreeCAD installation:

<!--Please keep this list consistent with Online_Help_Toc and Workbenches-->
* [[Image:Freecad.svg|32px]] [[Std_Base|Standard tools]]. These commands and tools are present in all workbenches.

* [[Image:Workbench_Assembly.svg|32px]] The [[Assembly_Workbench|Assembly Workbench]] for building and solving mechanical assemblies. {{Version|1.0}}

* [[Image:Workbench_BIM.svg|32px]] The [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] for working with architectural elements and creating [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling BIM] models. It combines the Arch Workbench and the formerly external BIM Workbench available in {{VersionMinus|0.21}}.

* [[Image:Workbench_CAM.svg|32px]] The [[CAM_Workbench|CAM Workbench]] is used to produce G-Code instructions. This workbench was called "Path Workbench" in {{VersionMinus|0.21}}.

* [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|32px]] The [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] contains 2D tools and basic 2D and 3D CAD operations.

* [[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|32px]] The [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]] provides Finite Element Analysis (FEA) workflow.

* [[Image:Workbench_Inspection.svg|32px]] The [[Inspection_Workbench|Inspection Workbench]] is made to give you specific tools for examination of shapes. Still in the early stages of development.

* [[Image:Workbench_Material.svg|32px]] The [[Material_Workbench|Material Workbench]] handles the FreeCAD material system. {{Version|1.0}}

* [[Image:Workbench_Mesh.svg|32px]] The [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] for working with triangulated meshes.

* [[Image:Workbench_OpenSCAD.svg|32px]] The [[OpenSCAD_Workbench|OpenSCAD Workbench]] for interoperability with OpenSCAD and repairing [[Constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) model history.

* [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|32px]] The [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] for working with geometric primitives and boolean operations.

* [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|32px]] The [[PartDesign_Workbench|Part Design Workbench]] for building Part shapes from sketches.

* [[Image:Workbench_Points.svg|32px]] The [[Points_Workbench|Points Workbench]]  for working with point clouds.

* [[Image:Workbench_Reverse_Engineering.svg|32px]] The [[Reverse_Engineering_Workbench|Reverse Engineering Workbench]] is intended to provide specific tools to convert shapes/solids/meshes into parametric FreeCAD-compatible features.

* [[Image:Workbench_Robot.svg|32px]] The [[Robot_Workbench|Robot Workbench]] for studying robot movements. Currently unmaintained.

* [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|32px]] The [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] for working with geometry-constrained sketches.

* [[Image:Workbench_Spreadsheet.svg|32px]] The [[Spreadsheet_Workbench|Spreadsheet Workbench]] for creating and manipulating spreadsheet data.

* [[Image:Workbench_Surface.svg|32px]] The [[Surface_Workbench|Surface Workbench]] provides tools to create and modify surfaces. It is similar to the [[Part_Builder|Part Builder]] Face from edges option.

* [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|32px]] The [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] for producing technical drawings from 3D models.

* [[Image:Workbench_Test.svg|32px]] The [[Testing|Test Framework Workbench]] is for debugging FreeCAD.

<span id="Macros"></span>
===Makro naredbe===

[[Macros|Macros]] are relatively small snippets of [[Python|Python]] code that perform a simple or a complex task that is not available in the base FreeCAD system.

Power users have written various [[macros|macros]] to enhance FreeCAD with more capabilities.

Since FreeCAD 0.17, many macros can be installed using the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For a list of the macros refer to the [[Macros_recipes|Macros recipes]] page. For manual installation see [[How_to_install_macros|How to install macros]].

===External workbenches===

When many macros or functions are developed together, and are organized in toolbars and menus, they can become a new workbench.

[[External_workbenches|External workbenches]] are collections of functions that are not part of the base FreeCAD system, usually developed by experienced users, and targeting a particular need.

Since FreeCAD 0.17, many workbenches can be installed using the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For manual installation see [[How_to_install_additional_workbenches|How to install additional workbenches]].

== Online Pomoć ==

<!-- To download the online help in FreeCAD you need to set the proper Url in the [[Preferences Editor|Preferences Editor]] of FreeCAD. Currently the right url has to point to this page. That means you need to set it to:
 [http://juergen-riegel.net/FreeCAD/Docu/index.php/User_hub http://juergen-riegel.net/FreeCAD/Docu/index.php/User_hub]
-->

This is the official FreeCAD online help. Please note that the whole online help system is currently being reworked. It will be used to generate a .CHM file, that will be distributed with the binary packages of FreeCAD. At the moment the online help summarizes some of the most complete sections of this wiki.
