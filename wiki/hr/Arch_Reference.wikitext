==Description==

The '''Arch Reference tool''' allows you to place an object in the current document that copies its shape and colors from a [[Part_Workbench|Part]]-based object (including [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]]) stored in another FreeCAD file. If that FreeCAD file changes, the reference object is marked to be reloaded.

==Usage==

# Press the {{KEY|[[Image:Arch_Reference.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Reference|External reference]]}} button,
# Press the "Choose file..." button and select an existing FreeCAD file,
# Select one of the included Part-based objects from the drop-down list,
# Press '''OK'''.

==Options==

* The reference object can be moved and rotated, the current position will be retained after reloading the object.
* If the original object gets moved in containing file, this movement will reflect in the reference object.
* By right-clicking a Reference object in the tree view, you have the options to reload the original object, or open the containing file.
* To reference several objects at once, place them inside an [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]].
* When turning off the '''Update Colors''' view property of the Reference, it won't reload the original colors anymore, so you can safely change them.

==Properties==

* {{PropertyData|File}}: The base file this component is built upon
* {{PropertyData|Part}}: The part to use from the base file
* {{PropertyView|Update Colors}}: If true, the colors from the linked file will be kept updated

==Scripting==

The Reference tool can by used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=
reference = makeReference([filepath], [partname], [name])
}}

Creates a {{incode|reference}} object named {{incode|name}} from the object {{incode|partname}} in the file {{incode|filepath}}. All arguments are optional.
