== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
User {{Emphasis|chrisb}} wrote the more than 80 page Sketcher Lecture. It is a reference manual for the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. For inexperienced users, it is a gentle introduction that covers the basic usage of the Sketcher, and then goes into many details of creating geometrical elements, and using each type of constraint.

<!--T:3-->
The manual is a work in progress, as some sections are reviewed and updated depending on the development occurring on the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. The original manual was written for FreeCAD 0.17, then it was updated for 0.18 and 0.19. The latest manual can be found in the forum thread, [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=30104 Sketcher tutorial].
