==Introduction==

Not everyone who has to deliver a drawing with their model gets by with only three main views (primary views) and grid-parallel sections. To depict a model from any possible angle designers rely on auxiliary views (secondary views) that are placed on a drawing page in a certain order to be able to retrace the way each view in a chain was defined. Disconnected views defined in 3D space that are randomly placed on the drawing page aren't a useful replacement for properly ordered auxiliary views.

For now this page only hosts a macro that is a proof of concept that shows that it is possible to define an auxiliary view within a base view without the detour via the 3D space. 

==Description==

The '''TechDraw AuxiliaryView''' macro adds an auxiliary view (AuxView object) to a TechDraw page. This is a simple view that is defined in a base view instead of 3D space.

===Example use case===

Let's assume we have a grid-parallel view and we want to develop other views to see the true shapes of the form features we want to dimension.

The key idea is to pick a straight line in a base view and define an auxiliary view perpendicular to it, this will be the base view for another auxiliary view along the straight line. We can chain auxiliary views until we have created all three main views of the of the object and on along its cylindrical sub-shape:

[[Image:TechDraw_AuxiliaryView_Pre02.png|400px]]
<translate>

The arbitrarily positioned straight line (red) in the Start view will be projected as a line of true length in AuxView X and as a point in AuxView Y where we can also see the true width and thickness of the base plate. AuxView Z is defined perpendicular to the base plate and presents the true shape of the base plate and its holes. AuxView R is perpendicular to the longer edge of the base plate and shows the true angles of the top and bottom face of the cylindrical sub-shape and how it fits to the base plate. The last one, AuxView S, is defined along the cylinder axis and shows the diameter and thickness of the cylindrical sub-shape.

Drawing auxiliary views manually requires a second base views to access the heights above the base view plane, but since FreeCAD does all the projection work, we can concentrate on the view direction solely. 

==Usage==

# Select two vertices in the same view.
# Run this macro.
# A new AuxiliaryView is created.
# Optionally add a view arrow and a proper title.

==Notes==

* The selection order of the vertices controls the view direction.
* The view origin is the center of the bounding box and thus useless for any geometric operation like measuring the distance to the line/vector between the selected vertices. Such a distance would allow to define a section line in the base view and use the information in 3D space to create a section view.
* The auxiliary views are placed at the page center by default and have to be positioned manually

"""
This script creates an Auxiliary View from two selectec vertices
of one base view.

What is required: an active document, a drawing page containing one
or more views with a projection of a shape.

A possible workflow:
1. Extract base view from selection (two vertices)
2. Extract work page from app objects
3. Add a new view
4. Link base view from selection to new view
5. Link base view source to new view source
6. Retrieve new view's x direction from base view's x direction
7. calculate new view's z direction from new view's x direction
    and base view's z direction
8. Set new view rotation including base view rotation
9. (Add annotations etc.)

I have tried to follow this naming rule:
 class names:    CamelCase
 function names: mixedCase
 constant names: ALL_CAPITAL + underscore
 variable names: lower_case + underscore
