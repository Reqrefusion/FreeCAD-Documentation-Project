==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The '''Arch SectionPlane''' tool places in the current document a section plane "thing", which defines a section or view plane. The "thing" takes its placement according to the current [[Draft_SelectPlane|Draft Working Plane]] and can be relocated and reoriented by moving and rotating it, until it describes the 2D view you want to obtain. The Section plane object will only consider a certain set of objects. Objects that are selected when you create a Section Plane will be added to that set automatically. Other objects can later be added or removed from a SectionPlane object with the [[Arch_Add|Arch Add component]] and [[Arch_Remove|Arch Remove component]] tools, or by double-clicking the Section Plane in the tree view.

<!--T:4-->
The Section Plane alone won't create any view of its objects set. For that, you must create a [[TechDraw_ArchView|TechDraw ArchView]] to create a view in a [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw page]]. 

<!--T:16-->

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# Optionally, set the [[Draft_SelectPlane|Draft Working Plane]] to reflect the plane where you want to place the Section Plane.
# Select objects you want to be included in your section view.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Arch_SectionPlane.svg|16px]] [[Arch_SectionPlane|Section Plane]]}} button or press {{KEY|S}} then {{KEY|P}} keys.
# [[Draft Move|Move]]/[[Draft Rotate|rotate]] the Section Plane into correct position if needed.
# Select the Section Plane if not selected already.
# Use either [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] or [[TechDraw_ArchView|TechDraw ArchView]] to create a view.

==Options== <!--T:7-->

<!--T:19-->
* The Section plane object will only consider  a certain set of objects, not all the objects of the document. Objects can be added or removed from a SectionPlane object by using the [[Arch_Add|Arch Add]] and [[Arch_Remove|Arch Remove]] tools, or by double-clicking the Section Plane in the tree view, selecting objects either in the list of in the 3D scene, and pressing the '''add''' or '''remove''' buttons.

<!--T:8-->
* With a section plane object selected, use the [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] tool to create a shape object representing the section view in the document.

<!--T:17-->
[[Image:Arch Section example2.jpg|600px]]

<!--T:9-->
* Create [[TechDraw_ArchView|TechDraw ArchView]].

<!--T:18-->
[[Image:Arch Section example3.jpg|600px]]

<!--T:20-->
* The Section Plane can also be used to show the entire 3D view cut by an infinite plane. This is only visual, and won't affect the geometry of the objects being cut.

<!--T:21-->

==Properties== <!--T:10-->

===Data===

{{Properties_Title|SectionPlane}}

<!--T:11-->
* {{PropertyData|Clip}}: If {{TRUE}}, the generated 2D view will be clipped to the extents of the section plane's rectangle, as defined by {{PropertyView|DisplayLength}} and {{PropertyView|DisplayHeight}}. Geometry outside the rectangle will be excluded. If {{FALSE}}, the view will show all geometry from the objects in scope, as seen from the plane's infinite projection.
* {{PropertyData|Depth}}: The distance behind the section plane up to which geometry will be shown in the generated 2D view. A value of 0 creates a view with unlimited depth.
* {{PropertyData|Objects}}: A list of objects that this section plane will consider when generating views. If this list is empty, the section plane will consider all objects in the document.
* {{PropertyData|Only Solids}}: If {{TRUE}}, non-solid objects in the set of considered objects will be disregarded during the view generation process.
* {{PropertyData|UseMaterialColorForFill}}: If {{TRUE}}, when generating a 2D view with filled cut areas, the fill color will be taken from the material of the cut object. If {{FALSE}}, a default fill color will be used.

<!--T:27-->
{{Caption|The Arch SectionPlane with the {{PropertyData|Clip}} property set to {{TRUE}} will behave like a camera, limiting the field of view.}}

===View===

{{Properties_Title|SectionPlane}}

* {{PropertyView|ArrowSize}}: The size of the arrow symbol at the corners of the section plane in the 3D view. This value also controls the length of the lines indicating the view direction. Doesn't affect the resulting view.
* {{PropertyView|CutDistance}}: This property is deprecated and has no effect. It was originally intended to create a thick visual slice in the 3D view.
* {{PropertyView|CutMargin}}: A small offset distance to apply between the section plane and the actual real-time cut plane when {{PropertyView|CutView}} is active. This helps prevent graphical artifacts (Z-fighting) on co-planar faces.
* {{PropertyView|CutView}}: If {{TRUE}}, enables a real-time clipping effect in the 3D view, visually cutting through the model at the plane's location.
* {{PropertyView|DisplayHeight}}: The height of the section plane's visual representation in the 3D view. This dimension is also used to define the boundary of the 2D view when the {{PropertyData|Clip}} data property is set to {{TRUE}}.
* {{PropertyView|DisplayLength}}: The width of the section plane's visual representation in the 3D view. This dimension is also used to define the boundary of the 2D view when the {{PropertyData|Clip}} data property is set to {{TRUE}}.
* {{PropertyView|FontSize}}: The size of the label text that is displayed in the 3D view.
* {{PropertyView|FontName}}: The font used for the label text.
* {{PropertyView|ShowLabel}}: If {{TRUE}}, the object's {{PropertyData|Label}} will be displayed next to the section plane in the 3D view.
* {{PropertyView|Transparency}}: Controls the transparency of the section plane's face in the 3D view, from 0 (fully opaque) to 100 (fully invisible).

==Tweaks== <!--T:28-->

<!--T:29-->
* Adding manually a property named '''RotateSolidRender''' of type '''App::PropertyAngle''' to the section plane's '''View''' properties (right-click the properties view -> show hidden, right-click again -> add property) allows to rotate the render when using Solid mode. This is useful when a rendered view has for example both Arch and Draft elements, and the rendering of the Arch elements is rotated in relation to the Draft elements.

==Scripting== <!--T:30-->

<!--T:12-->
{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch_API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

<!--T:13-->
The SectionPlane tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
Section = makeSectionPlane(objectslist=None, name="Section")
}}
<translate>

<!--T:14-->
* Creates a {{incode|Section}} object from {{incode|objectslist}}, which is a list of objects.

<!--T:15-->
Example:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, Draft, Arch

p1 = FreeCAD.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = FreeCAD.Vector(2000, 0, 0)
baseline = Draft.makeLine(p1, p2)
baseline2 = Draft.makeLine(p1, -1*p2)

Wall1 = Arch.makeWall(baseline, length=None, width=150, height=2000)
Wall2 = Arch.makeWall(baseline2, length=None, width=150, height=1800)
Structure = Arch.makeStructure(length=1000, width=1000, height=200)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

BuildingPart = Arch.makeBuildingPart([Wall1, Wall2])

Floor = Arch.makeFloor([BuildingPart])
Building = Arch.makeBuilding([Floor, Structure])
Site = Arch.makeSite(Building)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

Section1 = Arch.makeSectionPlane([Wall1, Wall2])
Section2 = Arch.makeSectionPlane([Structure])
Section3 = Arch.makeSectionPlane([Site])
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()
