==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The [[Image:Curves_EditableSpline.svg|24px]] [[Curves_EditableSpline|Curves EditableSpline]] creates a freehand B-spline curve. This tool is part of the [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] called [[Curves_Workbench|Curves]].

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# Switch to the [[Image:Curves_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] [[Curves_Workbench|Curves]] workbench (install from [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] is necessary, if not previously installed).
# Optionally select vertexes, edges and/or faces:
#* The number of vertexes of the spline will match the number of selected elements.
#* The spline vertexes will be snapped to the selected vertexes, and to the midpoints of the selected edges and faces.
# To invoke the command, do one of the following:
#* Press the [[Image:Curves_EditableSpline.svg|24px]] button in the Curves toolbar.
#* Use the {{MenuCommand|Curves → Freehand BSpline}} entry in the dropdown menu.

==Options== <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
During the command a special edit mode is active and there are several actions and behaviors that can be controlled by keys and mouse clicks.

<!--T:14-->
* To move a vertex or guide line (guide lines are the straight lines between vertexes) press and hold down the left mouse button on it, and move the mouse.
* The {{KEY|A}} key selects or deselects all vertexes and guide lines.
* The {{KEY|I}} key will add a vertex to the segment belonging to the selected guide line. The new vertex will be selected.
* The {{KEY|T}} key sets or un-sets tangent mode for the selected vertexes or guide lines (relative to the view direction).
* The {{KEY|P}} key aligns selected objects.
* The {{KEY|S}} key can be used to snap a vertex to a vertex belonging to another B-spline. With a vertex of the B-spline being edited selected, hold down the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key and add the target vertex to the selection, then hit the {{KEY|S}} key. The vertexes are snapped together.
* To unsnap vertexes, select the snapped vertex pair and again hit the {{KEY|S}} key. The vertex of the B-spline being edited remains selected and can now be moved.
* The {{KEY|L}} key sets or un-sets the linear interpolation.
* The {{KEY|X}}, {{KEY|Y}} or {{KEY|Z}} keys can be used to constrain the movement of the object being dragged. While dragging, hit the desired axis key. Hit the same key again to disable the constraint.
* The {{KEY|Q}} key finishes the command and exits edit mode.
