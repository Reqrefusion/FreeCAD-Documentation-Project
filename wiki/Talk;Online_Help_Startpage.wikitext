== Slice apart a Layer content ==

I am new using FreeCAD. I recently imported a 2D drawing from AutoCAD. The drawing contains walls and equipment. The equipment drawings are in a Layer. When I attempt to edit it, I cannot perform any edited command. For example, I want to delete a line, the action deleted all "the equipment drawings" not only the line. I tried to use the Split "Slice apart" command but it is not working.

How can I edit the Equipment layer? [[Special:Contributions/75.161.64.135|75.161.64.135]] 16:56, 12 November 2025 (UTC)
