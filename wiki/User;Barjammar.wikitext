Disappearing and Inactive Toolbar Tools

Many time while following a lesson on Youtube, I suddenly notice that a tool is inactive or disappeared.  This wastes a lot of time trying to get it back.  Today's example: I want to turn on the GRID.  I cant do it!.

I closed the file and reopened a new, blank file, then used the sketcher, chose xy axes and now I see the grid!

What did I do?

Answer:

When in this condition, if you right click in an empty area of the toolbar does the list show the toolbars in question? Are they ticked and/or greyed out
