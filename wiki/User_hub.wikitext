This is the main help area for newcomers to FreeCAD.

<!--T:3-->
FreeCAD is in continuous development, so there may be missing or outdated information. If you cannot find the information that you need, don't hesitate to ask in the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum].

===Basic application=== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
* [[Interface|Interface]]: the FreeCAD interface is composed of various graphical elements on the screen, including the [[3D_view|3D view]], the [[Tree_view|tree view]], the [[Property_editor|property editor]], the [[Task_panel|task panel]], and the [[Python_console|Python console]].
* [[Mouse_navigation|Mouse navigation]]: the different types of using the mouse or trackpad to navigate in the 3D view.
* [[Selection_methods|Selection methods]]: the different methods of selecting objects in the software.
* [[Object_name|Objects naming]]: FreeCAD objects have a read-only {{incode|Name}} that uniquely identifies them, and a {{incode|Label}} which is user editable.
* [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]]: the system that allows you to control many properties of the base system and of the individual workbenches.
* [[Import_Export|File formats]]: the different file formats that FreeCAD can read and write.

===Workbenches=== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:33-->
[[Workbenches|Workbenches]] are collections of tools used for specific tasks. The workbenches listed below are bundled with every FreeCAD installation.

{{Version|1.1}}: Some rarely used workbenches are disabled by default. These are marked with {{Incode|D}} below. A disabled workbench can be enabled in the [[Preferences_Editor#Workbenches|preferences]]. Disabled workbenches can still be activated via the {{Button|[[Image:List-add.svg|x16px]][[Image:Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg|x16px]]}} menu of [[Std_Workbench|TabBar Workbench selector]].

<!--T:42-->
<!--Please keep this list consistent with Online_Help_Toc and Workbenches-->

<!--T:67-->
* [[Image:Workbench_BIM.svg|32px]] The [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] for working with architectural elements and creating [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling BIM] models. It combines the Arch Workbench and the formerly external BIM Workbench available in {{VersionMinus|0.21}}.

<!--T:65-->
* [[Image:Workbench_CAM.svg|32px]] The [[CAM_Workbench|CAM Workbench]] is used to produce G-Code instructions. This workbench was called "Path Workbench" in {{VersionMinus|0.21}}.

<!--T:44-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|32px]] The [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] contains 2D tools and basic 2D and 3D CAD operations.

<!--T:45-->
* [[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|32px]] The [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]] provides Finite Element Analysis (FEA) workflow.

<!--T:47-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Inspection.svg|32px]] The [[Inspection_Workbench|Inspection Workbench]] is made to give you specific tools for examination of shapes. Still in the early stages of development. {{Incode|D}}

<!--T:68-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Material.svg|32px]] The [[Material_Workbench|Material Workbench]] handles the FreeCAD material system. {{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:48-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Mesh.svg|32px]] The [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] for working with triangulated meshes.

<!--T:49-->
* [[Image:Workbench_OpenSCAD.svg|32px]] The [[OpenSCAD_Workbench|OpenSCAD Workbench]] for interoperability with OpenSCAD and repairing [[Constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) model history. {{Incode|D}}

<!--T:50-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|32px]] The [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] for working with geometric primitives and boolean operations.

<!--T:51-->
* [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|32px]] The [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] for building Part shapes from sketches.

<!--T:53-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Points.svg|32px]] The [[Points_Workbench|Points Workbench]]  for working with point clouds.

<!--T:55-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Reverse_Engineering.svg|32px]] The [[Reverse_Engineering_Workbench|Reverse Engineering Workbench]] is intended to provide specific tools to convert shapes/solids/meshes into parametric FreeCAD-compatible features.

<!--T:56-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Robot.svg|32px]] The [[Robot_Workbench|Robot Workbench]] for studying robot movements. Currently unmaintained. {{Incode|D}}

<!--T:57-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|32px]] The [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] for working with geometry-constrained sketches.

<!--T:58-->

<!--T:62-->
* [[Image:Workbench_Test.svg|32px]] The [[Testing|Test Framework Workbench]] is for debugging FreeCAD. {{Incode|D}}

===Macros=== <!--T:24-->

<!--T:35-->
[[Macros|Macros]] are relatively small snippets of [[Python|Python]] code that perform a simple or a complex task that is not available in the base FreeCAD system.

<!--T:36-->
Power users have written various [[Macros|macros]] to enhance FreeCAD with more capabilities.

<!--T:32-->
Since FreeCAD 0.17, many macros can be installed using the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For a list of the macros refer to the [[Macros_recipes|Macros recipes]] page. For manual installation see [[How_to_install_macros|How to install macros]].

===External workbenches=== <!--T:23-->

<!--T:37-->
When many macros or functions are developed together, and are organized in toolbars and menus, they can become a new workbench.

<!--T:38-->
[[External_workbenches|External workbenches]] are collections of functions that are not part of the base FreeCAD system, usually developed by experienced users, and targeting a particular need.

<!--T:31-->
Since FreeCAD 0.17, many workbenches can be installed using the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]. For manual installation see [[How_to_install_additional_workbenches|How to install additional workbenches]].

This is the official FreeCAD online help. Please note that the whole online help system is currently being reworked. It will be used to generate a .CHM file, that will be distributed with the binary packages of FreeCAD. At the moment the online help summarizes some of the most complete sections of this wiki.
