==Description== 

The [[Image:Draft_Clone.svg|24px]] '''Draft Clone''' command creates linked copies, clones, of selected objects. The shape of a clone is parametric, it will update if its source object changes. But a clone does have its own position, rotation, and scale, and its own [[Property_editor|View properties]]. For [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] objects the command creates a special type of clone: an Arch Clone.

The command can be used on 2D objects created with the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] or [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]], but also on many 3D objects such as those created with the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]], [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] or [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]]. Clones of 2D objects can be used in [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Bodies]].

==Usage== 

# Optionally select one or more objects.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_Clone.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Clone|Clone]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Modification → [[Image:Draft_Clone.svg|16px]] Clone}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|C}} then {{KEY|L}}.
# If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

==Notes==

* The scaling of a Draft Clone can be changed in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]] or, {{Version|1.1}}, by double clicking it in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] and entering new values in the task panel that opens. The latter option is more efficient.

==Properties==

See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

An object created with the Draft Clone command is derived from a [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]], a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object or, if an Arch Clone is created, from the object type of the source object. It inherits all properties from that object. A clone derived from one of the first two objects also has the following additional properties:

===Data===

{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

* {{PropertyData|Fuse|Bool}}: specifies if overlapping shapes in the clone are fused or not.
* {{PropertyData|Objects|LinkListGlobal}}: specifies the objects that are cloned.
* {{PropertyData|Scale|Vector}}: specifies the X, Y and Z scale factors.

==Scripting==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

To create a clone use the {{incode|make_clone}} method ({{Version|0.19}}) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated {{incode|clone}} method.

{{Code|code=
cloned_object = make_clone(obj, delta=None, forcedraft=False)
}}

* {{incode|obj}} contains the objects to be cloned. It is either a single object or a list of objects.
* {{incode|delta}} is the displacement vector to be applied to the clone.
* If {{incode|forcedraft}} is {{incode|False}} and {{incode|obj}} contains a single [[BIM_Workbench|BIM object]], an Arch Clone is created. Set {{incode|forcedraft}} to {{incode|True}} to create a Draft Clone instead.
* {{incode|cloned_object}} is returned with the clone object.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

place = App.Placement(App.Vector(1000, 0, 0), App.Rotation())
polygon1 = Draft.make_polygon(3, 750)
polygon2 = Draft.make_polygon(5, 750, placement=place)

vector = App.Vector(2600, 500, 0)
cloned_object = Draft.clone([polygon1, polygon2], delta=vector)

cloned_object.Fuse = True

doc.recompute()
}}
