==Description== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
The '''Arch Panel''' tool allows you to build all kinds of panel-like elements, typically for panel constructions like the [https://www.wikihouse.cc/ WikiHouse] project, but also for all kinds of objects that are based on a flat profile.

<translate>

<!--T:7-->
''The above image shows a series of panel objects, simply made from imported 2D contours from a DXF file. They can then be rotated and assembled to create structures.''

<!--T:19-->
Since version {{VersionPlus|0.17}} the Arch Panel can also be used to create corrugated or trapezoidal profiles:

==Usage== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
# Select a 2D shape (Draft object, face or sketch) - optional.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Arch Panel.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Panel|Panel]]}} button, or press {{KEY|P}} then {{KEY|A}} keys.
# Adjust the desired properties.

=== Limitations === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
* There is currently no automatic system to produce 2D cutting sheets from panel objects, but such feature is in the plans and will be added in the future.

==Options== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
* The thickness of a panel can be adjusted after creation.
* Press {{KEY|Esc}} or the {{Button|Cancel}} button to abort the current command.
* Double-clicking on the panel in the tree view after it is created allows you to enter edit mode and access and modify its additions and subtractions.
* It is possible to automatically make panels composed of more than one sheet of a material, by raising its Sheets property.
* Panels can make use of [[Image:Arch_MultiMaterial.svg|24px]] [[Arch_MultiMaterial|Multi-Materials]]. When using a multi-material, the panel will become multi-layer, using the thicknesses specified by the multi-material. Any layer with a thickness of zero will have its thickness defined automatically by the remaining space defined by the Panel's own Thickness value, after subtracting the other layers.

==Properties== <!--T:12-->

<!--T:30-->
An Arch Panel object shares the common properties and behaviors of all [[Arch_Component|Arch Components]].

<!--T:13-->
* {{PropertyData|Length}}: The length of the panel
* {{PropertyData|Width}}: The width of the panel
* {{PropertyData|Thickness}}: The thickness of the panel
* {{PropertyData|Area}}: The area of the panel (automatic)
* {{PropertyData|Sheets}}: The number of sheets of material the panel is made of
* {{PropertyData|Wave Length}}: The length of the wave for corrugated panels
* {{PropertyData|Wave Height}}: The height of the wave for corrugated panels
* {{PropertyData|Wave Type}}: The type of the wave for corrugated panels, curved, trapezoidal or spiked
* {{PropertyData|Wave Direction}}: The orientation of the waves for corrugated panels
* {{PropertyData|Bottom Wave}}: If the bottom wave of the panel is flat or not

==Scripting== <!--T:28-->

<!--T:14-->
{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch_API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

<!--T:15-->
The Panel tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
Panel = makePanel(baseobj=None, length=0, width=0, thickness=0, placement=None, name="Panel")
}}
<translate>

<!--T:23-->
* Creates a {{incode|Panel}} object from the given {{incode|baseobj}}, which is a closed profile, and the given extrusion {{incode|thickness}}.
** If no {{incode|baseobj}} is given, you can provide the numerical values for the {{incode|length}}, {{incode|width}}, and {{incode|thickness}} to create a block panel.
* If a {{incode|placement}} is given, it is used.

<!--T:16-->
Example:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, Draft, Arch

Rect = Draft.makeRectangle(1000, 400)
Panel = Arch.makePanel(Rect, thickness=36)
}}
