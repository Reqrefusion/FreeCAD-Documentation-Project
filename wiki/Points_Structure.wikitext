==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The '''Points Structure''' command creates a structured point cloud from the points of an existing scattered point cloud. A structured point cloud has the advantage that tessellation is much easier.

<!--T:10-->
The command only works for point clouds whose points, when viewed from a certain direction, are organized in a regular 2D grid. These point clouds are typically produced by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured-light_3D_scanner structured-light 3D scanners] and do not have undercuts. For complex objects, point clouds from many different view directions have to be combined.

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# The command assumes that the view direction of the point cloud is parallel to the Z axis of the global coordinate system. If this is not the case: adjust the point cloud object's {{PropertyData|Placement}} accordingly.
# Select the point cloud object.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Points_Structure.svg|16px]] [[Points_Structure|Structured Point Cloud]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Points → [[Image:Points_Structure.svg|16px]] Structured Point Cloud}} option from the menu.
