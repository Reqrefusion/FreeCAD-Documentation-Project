{{term|Toggle}}
{{defn|defn=A setting that can be changed between two options, for example between True or False or between Off and On.}}
{{term|Topological Naming}}
{{defn|defn=A scheme whereby an edge or face, once created, is assigned a permanent name. Internally, FreeCAD identifies edges and faces on a solid by numbering them such as: Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2, etc. The problem is that these IDs are somewhat randomly applied, and they will change after something is done to the model that changes the amount of edges and faces. For example, if the model is revised an item linked to a Face2 could later erroneously become linked to a different face (which was renamed to become the new Face2), causing the user unwanted results.  As of the FreeCAD 0.20 release Topological Naming has not yet been implemented, and so if an object is modified such that the number of edges or faces changes, the names of the edges or faces of that object might change too.}}
{{term|Torus}}
{{defn|defn=A primitive shape.}}
{{term|Tracker}}
{{defn|defn=Short for bug tracker, the online software application used to keep track of reported bugs or feature requests. See also [[#Mantis|Mantis]].}}
