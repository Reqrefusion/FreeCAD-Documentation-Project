In the explanation in the Caveats section, isn't the Mirror operation a Transform operation rather than a dress-up operation?

And in the final image of the same section, it would be better to show the result of the mirroring (two slots).

Some choice of words, maybe dictated by a different mother tongue, are arguably less ideal in their most common English meaning (IE use of "solitary" to rather indicate "idependent"?). Some sentences are also unnecessarily convoluted (for example, nesting different level ofparentheses). I am not familiar with the workbech, although I can make some work to rearrange already established concepts into a more efficient message.
