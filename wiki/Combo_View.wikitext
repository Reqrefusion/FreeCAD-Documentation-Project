== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:21-->
The [[Combo_view|Combo view]] appears in a panel called '''Model'''. It combines the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] (upper section) and the [[Property_editor|Property editor]] (lower section).

<!--T:22-->
The [[Task_panel|Task panel]], which used to be part of the Combo view, is a separate panel called '''Tasks''' in {{VersionPlus|1.0}}. It can be [[#Dock_Task_panel_on_top_of_Combo_view|docked]] on top of the Combo view to achieve the compact layout of earlier versions.
