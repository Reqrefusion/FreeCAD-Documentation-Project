==Description==

Inserts a primitive prism in the active Body as the first feature, or fuses it to the existing feature(s).

[[File:PartDesign_AdditivePrism_example.png|200px]]

==Usage==

# Press the {{Button|[[Image:PartDesign AdditivePrism.svg|24px]] '''Additive Prism'''}} button. '''Note''': the Additive Prism is part of an icon menu labelled ''Create an additive primitive''. After launching FreeCAD, the Additive Box is the one displayed in the toolbar. To get the Prism, click on the down arrow besides the visible icon and select Additive Prism in the menu.
# Set the Primitive parameters and [[Part_EditAttachment|Attachment]].
# Click {{Button|OK}}.
# A Prism feature appears under the active Body.

==Options==

It is possible to create skewed prisms by specifying angles in respect to the normal vector of the chosen attachment.

The Prism can be edited after its creation in two ways:
* Double-clicking it in the Model tree, or by right-clicking and selecting '''Edit primitive''' in the contextual menu; this brings up the Primitive parameters.
* Via the [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

==Properties==

* {{PropertyData|Attachment}}: defines the attachment mode as well as the Attachment Offset. See [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]].
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: label given to the Prism object. Change to suit your needs.
* {{PropertyData|Polygon}}: number of sides in the polygon cross-section of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|Circumradius}}: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle circumscribed radius] of the polygon cross-section of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|Height}}: height of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|First Angle}}: angle in first direction.
* {{PropertyData|Second Angle}}: angle in second direction.
