<!--T:2-->
This is the place to come if you want to contribute to the development of the FreeCAD software. 

<!--T:3-->
These pages are in the early stage of development.  If you can't find the information you are looking for, or have found useful information somewhere we have not linked to, then please leave a comment on the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/index.php?sid=5f84150e79db8842e277b042077097ff  forum] and someone will look into it (or, if you are feeling bold, why not edit this page directly!).

=== Internals === <!--T:21-->

==== OpenCascade Documentation ==== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:17-->
OpenCascade is a software development platform for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data exchange, and visualization, mostly in the form of C++ libraries.

<!--T:18-->
* [http://opencascade.wikidot.com/romansarticles Roman Lygin's tutorials]
* [https://dev.opencascade.org/cdoc/overview/html/index.html Full Online Documentation]
* [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/index.html Reference Manual]
* [http://opencascade.wikidot.com The openCascade wiki] (currently containing ?? Chinese spam)

==== File format ==== <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
[[File_Format_FCStd|File Format FCStd]]. The files created with FreeCAD are {{incode|.zip}} files that include the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation BREP] geometry, as well as XML data that describes the document.

==== Sketcher solver ==== <!--T:22-->

<!--T:23-->
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=36355 Sketcher Solver Architecture Booklet] (forum thread), [https://github.com/abdullahtahiriyo/FreeCADBooks/tree/master/FreeCAD_Solver_Architecture source] in GitHub.
* [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/ PlaneGCS solver] in the FreeCAD source code; important files are [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/GCS.cpp GCS.cpp] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/blob/master/src/Mod/Sketcher/App/planegcs/SubSystem.cpp SubSystem.cpp].
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=29192 Recent Several Sketcher improvements].

<!--T:24-->
The sketcher solver isn't perfect, as there are some issues with numerical precision when using large values, see [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=40502 Adventure of fixing sketcher solver for large sketches].

<!--T:25-->
The development of a new solver architecture could improve the way the solver is used both in the [[Sketcher Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]], and for assembly of 3D bodies. See [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=40525 Reimplementing constraint solver].

== Roadmap == <!--T:37-->

<!--T:9-->
FreeCAD, though usable in certain areas, is at the beginning of a long way into the CAD mainstream. There is still a lot to do 
to reach a state where we can compete with commercial software.

== Community == <!--T:30-->

<!--T:31-->
* [ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/freecad IRC channel] ,synchronized with [https://gitter.im/FreeCAD/FreeCAD gitter channel]
