== Welcome to the FreeCAD on-line help == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The FreeCAD help system is hosted on a [https://wiki.freecad.org wiki] built, maintained and developed by the FreeCAD community of users and developers. It contains general information about FreeCAD, tutorials, precise documentation about each FreeCAD command, and programming documentation for Python and C++. It also contains translations of this documentation in several languages. We hope you will find here all the information you need. In case you have questions you can't find answers to in this documentation, have a look at the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum], where you might find your question answered already, or find someone able to help you.

=== How to use === <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
This document is divided into several sections:
# [[User_hub|Introduction and usage]], for end-users who simply want to use the program.
# [[Power_users hub|Python scripting]], for power-users who are interested by the scripting capabilities of FreeCAD and would like to customize some of its aspects.
# [[Developer_hub|Development guidelines]], for developers who consider FreeCAD as a base for developing their own applications.

<!--T:13-->
Many pages of this wiki are also grouped into an easier to read [[Manual|Manual]]. If you are new to FreeCAD, we suggest you start reading the manual.

As you may have experienced sometimes, programmers are sometimes bad documentation writers! It is therefore vital that experienced users help to write, update, fix and revise the documentation. Yes, we mean you! Editing the wiki is [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting easy]. As this wiki is write-protected to reduce spamming, you will need a FreeCAD wiki account to log in. Ask [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=6830 on the forum] and we will create an account for you. Currently, the wiki account is separate from the forum account but we will create you a wiki account with the same name as your forum account. Then you can start editing!  Also, check out [https://wiki.freecad.org/index.php?title=Help_FreeCAD this page] for more ways you can help FreeCAD.
