==Description==

The [[File:Cables_CableTerminal.svg|24px]] [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] is a dependent object and cannot be created directly.

It represents electrical connection point for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]]. It can be created as a child object during creation of: [[Cables_CableConnector|CableConnector]], [[Cables_ElecticalDevice|ElectricalDevice]]. Its main purpose is to indicate positon for cable end inside connector or electrical device. If more cable wires have to be connected to single terminal it can be splitted into segments allowing more items to connect to them. The '''CableTerminal''' is fully parametric, which means it has configurable length, number of allowed connections and placement relative to its parent.

The '''CableTerminal''' is prepared to be a part of electrical net and has properties: '''Pin Name''', '''Node Name''' and '''Connected Wires''' which can be used for net analysis in future releases of '''Cables Workbench'''. Each terminal represents single pin or connection point inside connector or electrical device.

<u>Important:</u> the real relation between '''CableTerminal''' and its parent is reversed to avoid cyclic dependencies and to speed up recalculation. This has some consequences (see [[#Notes|Notes]]).

==Usage==

The '''CableTerminal''' object cannot be created directly.
It is made during creation of: [[Cables_CableConnector|CableConnector]], [[Cables_ElecticalDevice|ElectricalDevice]] depending on '''Number Of Terminals''' property of these objects.

==Notes==

* The '''CableTerminal''' has reversed relation with its parent to avoid cyclic dependencies. It is shown as a child in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] only for visual organization of objects. Undesirable consequence: when a parent is copied, all its child terminals must always be manually copied with it.
* The '''CableTerminal''' has two supporting commands: [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire to Terminal]], [[Cables_DetachWireFromTerminal|Detach Wire from Terminal]]. They allow easy connection and disconnection of [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] objects to '''CableTerminal'''. It is <u>strongly recommended</u> tu use the above commands when connecting the terminal to wire because they perform necessary changes to terminal properties in the background.
* The '''CableTerminal''' properties are set upon creation by its parent object. Some of them can be changed manually later.
* If a [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] is built upon connected [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] the value of [[Cables_Cable#Data|{{PropertyData|Stripped Wire Length}}]] property of a cable needs to be higher then the terminal length ([[#Data|{{PropertyData|Length}}]]). Some other cable and WireFlex properties may need to be adjusted (like e.g. '''Boundary Segment Start''' or '''Boundary Segment End''') for the connection to display correctly.

==Properties==

===Data===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

* {{PropertyData|Attachment Offset|Placement}}: Contains offset placement relative to terminal parent object. It is set upon terminal creation, but can be adjusted according to user needs.

{{TitleProperty|Net}}

* {{PropertyData|Connected Wires|StringList}}: (read only) Contains the list of connected wires with number of connection. This property is updated automatically on terminal object recompute. The connected wires are not real child objects of the terminal. They are only visible as children in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].
* {{PropertyData|Node Name|String}}: Contains the name of terminal node. The node name should be the same for all terminals connected to each other by electrical wires. The '''Node Name''' refers to 'Node' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(circuits) definition] in electrical network. In current version the '''Node Name''' is not verified automatically between connected terminals.
* {{PropertyData|Pin Name|String}}: Contains the functional name of the pin or connection point in a connector or electrical device.

{{TitleProperty|Terminal}}

* {{PropertyData|Length|Length}}: Contains the length of the terminal
* {{PropertyData|Number Of Connections|Integer}}: Contains the number of connection segments in the terminal.
* {{PropertyData|Spacing|Length}}: Contains the distance between connection segments in the terminal.
