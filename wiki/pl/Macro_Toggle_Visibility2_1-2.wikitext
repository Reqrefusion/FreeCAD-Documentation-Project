==Description==
{{ColoredText|This macro work with [[Macro_Toggle_Visibility2_2-2|Macro Toggle Visibility2 2-2]]}}

This is a set of four related macros for managing the visibility of objects in the Object Model:
# objects that are selected in a document are made visible while objects that are not selected are made invisible
#*if no objects are selected then all objects are hidden;
#*if all objects are selected then all objects are made visible
# make all objects visible

==How To Use==
Copy the macros and the icons in your folder macros and run (see [[How to install macros|How to install macros]])

==ToggleVisibility==
Using the selection of objects in the one of the FreeCAD views, this macro makes all selected objects visible and hides all objects which are not selected.

If no object(s) are selected then all objects are hidden 

If all objects are hidden and there is no selection in ComboView then all object are made visible
