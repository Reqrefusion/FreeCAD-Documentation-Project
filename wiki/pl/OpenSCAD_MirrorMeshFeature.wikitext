==Description== 

Creates a new mirrored mesh object, mirrored about the selected axis.

==Usage== 

# Select the mesh object to be mirrored.
# Click the {{KEY|OpenSCAD → Mirror Mesh Feature...}} menu.
# Select the desired axis in the dialog, or enter your own custom axis to use and click OK.
* A new object is created and mirrored, the original object is rendered hidden.

==Limitations== 

* The new mesh object is not parametric to the original mesh object, which means any changes to the original object do not get reflected in the new mirrored object.

==Notes== 

* The function does not modify the existing mesh, but returns a new mesh.
* The function can be accessed via Python:

{{Code|code=
import OpenSCADUtils
import Mesh
#this assumes an existing object in the document named "Mesh" that you wish to mirror
original_mesh = App.ActiveDocument.Mesh
mirrored_mesh = OpenSCADUtils.mirrormesh(original_mesh.Mesh, FreeCAD.Base.Vector(1,0,0))
Mesh.show(mirrored_mesh)
}}
