* Redesigned Start center
* The Document tree (Model tab) now offers 3 options for how all documents are displayed, with the option set from the menu {{MenuCommand|View → Document Tree}} :
** Single Document (Only display the currently active document)
** Multi Document (Display all documents as it used to be up to FreeCAD 0.17)
** Collapse/Expand (Expand the active document and collapse all others)
* When a task is active and requires user input, an icon showing a pencil now appears on the Tasks tab and disappears when the task is completed. 
* The 3D view now benefits from a new '''[[Navigation_Cube|Navigation Cube]]''' to quickly orientate the view. It also has a small menu to set the projection to orthographic or perspective, as well as to fit the content to the view. The placement of the navigation cube can be set in {{MenuCommand|Preferences → Display → 3D View}} and it can also be hidden.
* Generic support for US Civil / Transportation Engineering units has been added.  These units include ft, ft^2, ft^3, mph, and angles as degrees/minutes/seconds.  These units allow for expression of feet in decimal form, as opposed to US Building, which forces fractions of inches.
* It is now possible to specify a custom background image for FreeCAD's main window using the option [[Preferences_Editor#General|{{MenuCommand|Preferences → General → Enable tiled background}}]].

[[File:Arch_release018_example.jpg|700px|thumb|right|The Arch workbench at work]]
* [[Arch Wall|Walls]] can now be displayed as a stack of blocks. There are many options to configure their size and how blocks must be stacked.
* [[Arch BuildingPart|Building Parts]] are the new use-for-all Arch container. They can group any number of objects, they can be used to make floors (storeys), buildings (the [[Arch Floor]] and [[Arch Building|Arch Building]] tools now produce Building Parts), or any other group of Arch objects. They can be moved like [[Std Part|Parts]], and they are [[Draft Clone|clonable]] and [[Arch Reference|referencable]]!
* The [[BIM Workbench]] (added via the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]]), is a new external, experimental counterpart of [[Arch Workbench|Arch]]. In it, we test new features and workflows in a more free environment. Be sure to give it a test ride!
* [[Arch Window|Windows]] have new presets such as a 4-pane sliding window, plus, if the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library/tree/c5eea12cdda7a3e6349323808815f63b0f97ef2e Parts Library] is installed, all the doors and windows from the library.
* [[Arch Panel|Panels]] can now do different kinds of corrugated panels, such as undulated sheets, or even sandwich panels.
* [[Arch Structure|Structure]] objects have a new beam drawing mode, which allow you to click two points to place a structural element between them.
* All IFC types are now available for all Arch objects. Any object can be exported to any other type to IFC.
* [[Arch Window|Window placement]] has been fully redesigned. Correctly placing windows in host objects, which was before a real pain to do is now much easier.
* Dynamic window parameters: The size of the window frames is now a window property, so it is now possible to adjust the thickness of preset windows without the need to edit their components or base sketches.
* IFC Property Sets are now supported by all Arch objects.
* The IFC importer and exporter have been greatly enhanced with a wealth of new features: Property sets support, grid support, file compression, shared profiles, groups support, quantity sets, etc...
* [[Arch SetMaterial|Materials]] now support hierarchy, if you give a material another material as father, they appear correctly stacked in the tree.
* All Arch objects and materials now support classification systems (not yet supported by IFC import/export).
* [[Arch Reference|External references]] now allow you to link parts from another FreeCAD file into a FreeCAD file.

* The [[Draft Scale|Draft Scale]] tool has been fully redesigned, and has now more options and is much more comfortable to use
* The [[Draft Text|Draft Text]] tool has also been fully redesigned, it now has its own parametric object with many more options. Warning, these new texts are not supported by 0.17
* [[Draft Wire|Draft Wires]] now have a right-click option that allows to force-flatten them on their median plane
* New [[Draft Join|Draft Join]] tool, which allows you to join individual wires and lines into a single wire
* New [[Draft Split|Draft Split]] tool, which splits a line or a wire at a point to create another wire or line
* Pressing the {{KEY|`}} key while drawing in draft mode cycles the snapping object target, allowing you to snap on objects that are obscured by others
* The Draft AddPoint tool has been improved to more reliably add nodes on lines and wires exactly where you click

== FEM Workbench ==
[[Image:FEM-Material-dialog-018.png|300px|thumb|right|The polished FEM material dialog]] In 0.17, tons of new features were added to FEM. Thus, the main focus for FEM in the 0.18 release of FreeCAD was not adding even more new features and tools, but making the existing ones more stable and fixing as many bugs as possible. FEM got 470 commits during FreeCAD 0.18 development cycle [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13154&p=297292#p297110].
</div>

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The [[Part CheckGeometry|Check Geometry]] tool now opens a small window with a progress bar and a {{Button|Cancel}} button to end the task if it takes too long.
* The new [[Defeaturing_Workbench|Defeaturing]] tool is based on the tool of the same name included in OCCT 7.3.0. It can remove selected attributes on a solid such as holes, protrusions, gaps, chamfers, fillets, etc. For more info, see [https://dev.opencascade.org/index.php?q=node/1211 3D Model Defeaturing] article on the OCCT website. Please note that if FreeCAD is built on an older version that OCCT 7.3.0, this tool won't be available and will be greyed out.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The new [[Part_SliceApart|SliceApart]] tool is based on the  [[Part_Slice|Slice to Compound]] and includes an automatic compound explode for easily splitting objects.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

== Sketcher Workbench ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:Sketch-clip-plane-demo.png|700px|thumb|right|Sketcher View Section demo]]
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The new '''[[Sketcher ViewSection|View section]]''' tool creates a section plane that removes matter on the model that is in front of the sketch plane. This can be useful when the sketch plane is located inside a solid model. Pressing the View section tool again toggles the view back to a full view.
* The '''Sketcher solver''' benefited from improvements and is now better at detecting redundant and conflicting constraints, especially those induced by symmetric constraints.
* New '''[[Sketcher ConstrainDiameter|Constrain Diameter]]''' tool added
* '''DoF Finder''' is a new utility to help find degrees of freedom. In the Solver messages widget in the Tasks panel, the traditional message ''Under-constrained sketch with x degrees of freedom'' now underlines the ''x degrees'' text in blue. Clicking on it will highlight in green, in the 3D view, the elements that are not fully constrained.
* '''Sketcher Auto Remove Redundants''' is a new checkbox in the Solver messages box. When enabled, it will prevent creation of redundant constraint when the user is sketching and applying constraints, and it will automatically delete the redundant constraints.
* There is a new command to delete all constraints at once. It can be found in the menu {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Sketcher tools → Delete All Constraints}}.
* New option in {{MenuCommand|Preferences → Sketcher → General → Hide base length units for supported unit systems}}. This hides the unit for dimensional constraints while in sketch editing mode.
* Size of vertices (points) can now be set in {{MenuCommand|Preferences → Display → 3D View → Marker size}}.
* New '''[[Sketcher Move|Move]]''' command to move all selected geometry from the last selected point. It can be access under the Clone tool drop down.
* Added ''Extended Information'' checkbox to the Constraints list widget.
