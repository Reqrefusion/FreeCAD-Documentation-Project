==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
[[File:PartDesign_MoveFeatureInTree.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_MoveFeatureInTree|Move Feature After]], as this command is labeled in the context menu, allows reordering of objects under a Body. Sketches, datum geometry and features are supported.

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# In the Model [[Tree_view|tree view]], select the object(s) to be moved then right-click to open the context menu.
# Select '''Move Feature After…'''.
# In the '''Select feature''' dialog, select the object under which to move the object(s).
# Press {{Button|OK}}.

==Example== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:8-->
The following three pictures show the same model with a pocket defined on a sketch attached to the datum plane. The features are reordered from one picture to the other. This has the effect that the pocket makes either no hole or makes holes in different pads, depending on the order of the features in the model tree.
