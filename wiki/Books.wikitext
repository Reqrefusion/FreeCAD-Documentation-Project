Learn 3D design with FreeCAD through real-world examples and hands-on projects.

Discover the world of 3D design with FreeCAD, the free and open-source CAD software used by engineers, designers, and makers worldwide. This full-color, practical guide takes you step by step through a reliable modeling workflow, showing you how to create real-world products and inventions, and even complete a complex project like designing a Mars Rover from scratch to solidify your knowledge.

* Gain the confidence to develop your own inventions, from initial idea to finished, 3D-printable product.
* Learn the fundamentals of solid 3D modeling and how to apply them effectively in FreeCAD.
* Create individual 3D parts using Part Design and Sketcher, then digitally assemble them to verify their function.
* Prepare and export models for 3D printing using slicer software, ensuring your designs are ready for production.
* Complete projects that teach real-world applications of 3D design, including practical gadgets and a Mars Rover project to consolidate your skills.

By the end of this book, you will be able to design your own innovative gadgets, explore real-world engineering solutions, and confidently prepare models for 3D printing. The included Mars Rover project provides a challenging yet rewarding opportunity to apply all the techniques learned in a single, cohesive design.

FreeCAD is the number one free software 3D design program, and this PDF guide is the best way to get started with it. We’ll take you from absolute beginnner to advanced user, going from the basics of drawing a line and making it 3D all the way to parametric design, importing objects from photographs, designing for sheet metal, and loads more.

<!--T:5-->
Because FreeCAD is free software, its users can add to it, writing extensions to the software to suit their needs. These add-ons, known as workbenches, cover a range of uses, including PCB design, pipes, timber-framing, architectural design… the list of practical use cases goes on and on. So, whatever you’re interested in building, you’ll find a FreeCAD workbench for it.

Do you want to start using a free and open-source software to work in your CAD related projects? Meet FreeCAD and their incredible array of options to create both technical drawings and 3D models for architecture, engineering, and more.

<!--T:10-->
In this book, you will learn how to use FreeCAD to create traditional technical drawings for architecture. As an example of project development, you will learn how to draw a full featured floor plan using FreeCAD. We will add to that floor plan all traditional elements from an architectural drawing like furniture, dimension lines, text annotations, and much more.

<!--T:11-->
In the final chapters, we can take this floor plan design and export it using either the DXF format or as a PDF. You will be able to add the floor plan to page layout for print featuring a title block from a template in FreeCAD.

<!--T:12-->
You don't need any previous experiences with FreeCAD, since we will start from the beginning. From the user interface basics to drawing a floor plan!

FreeCAD is a general purpose platform for CAD development. It can be extended to use different workbenches to solve different problems. Targeted squarely at the engineering community, FreeCAD is an open source design application built to be extended. Python, the powerful scripting language, is woven deeply into FreeCAD’s DNA and gives users unprecedented power to automate and invent.

<!--T:21-->
"FreeCAD [How-to]" is a lean, fast tour of FreeCAD's major workbenches and design philosophy. The reader will get a hands-on introduction to several modeling techniques and learn how Python makes macro automation and design possible.

<!--T:22-->
FreeCAD allows users to design in a variety of ways; from drawing 2D designs as lines and circles to combining primitive solids into complex 3D shapes. Objects can even be created or modified by code you write in Python. FreeCAD even allows power users to extend the application itself with new dialogs, panels, and scripts. This book will not only show you how to get started using FreeCAD in a traditional GUI mode, but will teach you how to harness its powerful scripting language for more power.
