A fatal error occurred when making the pipe.

I have thoughts. I wrote some of them as they came to me on my mastodon.

Buttom line: until the cryptic error messages point to this excellent documentation page, this page will not be helpful to those who hit the cryptic error messages. I know that's got to get fixed in the code. 

So until then, maybe we should add a reference to: "A fatal error occurred when making the pipe." in the bottom troubleshooting section so a web search might find it rather than random old forum posts?

I may be unaware of more general discussions around UX. But this idea may be a quick and pragmatic short term solution that can be removed once the UX improves.
