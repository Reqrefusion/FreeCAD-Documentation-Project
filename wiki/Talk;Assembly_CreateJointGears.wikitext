== Assembly Consisting of Bevel Gears At Right Angles ==

I'm attempting to model a replicate of the gear assembly shown in this video consisting of four bevel gears arranged at right angles to each other.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPragUdzniM

I've modeled the gears using the Gears workbench but am at a loss for how to assemble the parts.  The constraints I apply, using either Assembly workbench or A2Plus workbench, do not create the reaction I am intending.  Specific issues are...

# The centerline of all gears needs to be in the same plane, but I can't reference the axis of the gear holes to align them.
# Attempts to align the gears at right angles to each other only makes them parallel.
# I flat out don't understand the prompt for the Gears constraint in Assembly workbench.
# In A2Plus workbench no matter what constraints I attempt I cannot get the gear teeth to mesh properly.

I've searched online but am not finding guidance on a right-angle gear assembly.  Would appreciate any help I could get.  Thanks. [[User:Olds70supreme|Olds70supreme]] ([[User talk:Olds70supreme|talk]]) 03:10, 15 September 2025 (UTC)
