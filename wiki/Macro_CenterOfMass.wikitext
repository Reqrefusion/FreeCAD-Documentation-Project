==Usage== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:9-->
# Select one or more solids.
# Launch the macro.
# You'll have a window listing the solids. You can specify the density of your material in different unit systems or choose from predefined materials.

===Available Options=== <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
* Color the solids according to density.
* Display the location of the center of mass.
* Export and import ''masses'', ''materials'' and ''densities'' (even if it's not a {{FileName|.csv}} file from the macro, but columns must be named accordingly).
* Save densities in the document (remove them again when setting material to {{ComboBox|default}}).
* You can change some preferences at {{MenuCommand|Tools → Edit parameters → Preferences → Macros}}.

==Script== <!--T:11-->

<!--T:13-->

* New: Show Volume and Surface area
* New: Calculate Moments of Inertia
* Fix: Macro now works with the Assembly example in FreeCAD 1.0
* Fix: Automatically select material for solids if it is already assigned by the new material system
* Minor UI changes

<!--T:37-->
0.7.6 / 2024-08-01: Prepare for major FreeCAD release
* Fix: Make 0.22.0dev AssemblyExample work
* Fix: BOM Import containing custom material

<!--T:32-->
0.7.0 / 2023-02-13:
* New: Searchbar for solids
* New: Reworked import function to improve external bill of materials (BOM) import with better input tolerance. Caption "weight" has to be changed to "mass" if you want to import mass from an old file export of the macro.
* New: Mass can be set zero to exclude solid from calculation and visualization
* Fix: Behaviour of default value spin and "Apply to all"

* New: Highlights the solid you are working on
* New: No duplicate entries when container and content selected concurrently
* New: Pie charts show density relation in combo box
* New: Legibility of text on colored combo box with WCAG21 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) conformity
* Fix: A Part used as a container for meshes (e.g. .stl's) is recognized correctly
* Fix: Fixes for error and language handling, material editing, combo box and GUI size adjustment

<!--T:34-->
0.5.8 / 2022-05-31:
* Reinserted: Bounding Box

* New: Code base, Requirement raised to Qt5.12+ and Python3 (FreeCAD 0.19).
* New: Show mass of each solid.
* New: Start window docked or floating (can be set in Parameter Editor).
* New: Selection matches up tree view or is sorted by name (can be set in Parameter Editor).
* New: Option to save densities in document.
* Improved: FreeCAD alike Gui look and feel.
* Improved: Scaled color palette (from green to red) to colorify shapes.
* Improved: Visualising the displacement of centre of mass to the geometry.
* Improved: Internal tracking of units.
