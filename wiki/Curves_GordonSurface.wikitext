==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The tool [[Image:Curves_GordonSurface.svg|24px]] [[Curves_GordonSurface|Curves GordonSurface]] creates a surface that skins a network of curves.

<translate>

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# A Gordon surface requires a network of lines or curves that create a support network for the surface.
#* The surface will be "tented" between and over these lines.
# In the example above the blue lines (or ribs) represent the shape of the surface at different points along surface.
#* These can be thought of as cross sections along the surface. Or, like supports that the surface will "tent" over.
# The yellow lines represent the extent and shape of the surface between the cross sections ("ribs") defined by the blue lines.
# These lines (blue & yellow) can be created in sketches.
#* The sketches containing the blue ribs would typically have a placement offset.
#** Each "rib" is in a separate sketch.
#* The sketches containing the extent/shape (yellow) lines will typically reference external geometry from the "rib" sketches for accurate positioning.
# These need to be created before the next step.
# Switch to the [[Image:Curves_workbench_icon.svg|24px]] [[Curves_Workbench|Curves]] workbench (install from [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] is necessary, if not previously installed)
# Now select all the lines of that will define the surface.
# The order of selection defines the stitching or tenting order.
# Use multi-select to select all lines defining the surface. (Left click while holding the Ctrl key.)
# Select the ribs first, in order. (In the example above, select the blue lines from left to right. or right to left.)
# Continue to hold the Ctrl key and select the extent lines. (Yellow lines in the example above.)
# To invoke the command, do one of the following:
#* Press the [[Image:Curves_GordonSurface.svg|24px]] button
#* Use the command {{MenuCommand|Surfaces → Gordon surface}}

==Properties== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:12-->
* {{PropertyData|Placement}}: Can be used to adjust the placement of the resulting Gordon surface. See: [[Placement|Placement]]
** Note: The Placement properties do not adjust the placement of the curves/lines used to create the surface, only the surface.
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: User specified label (name) for the surface. (Default: Gordon)
* {{PropertyData|Output}}: Defines the output type. (Default: Surface, Options: Surface, Wireframe)
* {{PropertyData|Gordon>Max Ctrl Pts}}: (Default: 80)
* {{PropertyData|Gordon>Sources}}: User selected lines that are used to create the Gordon surface.
* {{PropertyData|Gordon>Tol3D}}: 3D tolerance (Default: 0.01)
* {{PropertyData|Wireframe>Samples U}}: Number of samples in the U direction. (Default: 16)
** This value is used to determine density of the mesh when the Output property is set to Wireframe.
* {{PropertyData|Wireframe>Samples V}}: Number of samples in the V direction. (Default: 16)
** This value is used to determine density of the mesh when the Output property is set to Wireframe.
** Gordon surface in wire frame mode, U=16, V=16

==Notes== <!--T:7-->

<!--T:13-->
* The curves of each group (ribs and rails) should touch all curves of the other group.
** In other words, they must form a grid or net pattern as shown here:
[[File:grid.png|200px]]
* In general, the surface normal of the resulting Gordon surface will be determined by the direction of the ribs.
In this example, the surface on the left, the rails were drawn from +Y to -Y and the resulting surface normal is +Z
<br>
On the right, the ribs are drawn from -Y to +Y, resulting in the surface normal oriented -Z.

<!--T:15-->
* [[Part_Extrude|Part Extrude]] can be used to create a solid from the surface.

<!--T:16-->
* [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]] can also create a solid from the surface. Dragging the surface into a Body creates a [[PartDesign_Body#Base_Feature|Base Feature]] that can then be padded.
