== Description == <!--T:51-->

<!--T:2-->
The [[Image:Part_Extrude.svg|24px]] '''Part Extrude''' command extends a shape by a specified distance, in a specified direction. The output shape type will vary depending on the input shape type and the options selected.

<!--T:4-->
In most common scenarios, the following lists the expected output shape type from a given input shape type, 
*  Extruding a Vertex (point) will produce a straight Edge (Line) 
*  Extruding an open edge (e.g. line, arc) will produce an open face (e.g. plane)  
*  Extruding a closed edge (e.g. circle) will optionally produce a closed face (e.g. an open-ended cylinder) or if the parameter "solid" is "true" will produce a solid (e.g. a closed solid cylinder) 
*  Extruding an open Wire (e.g. a Draft Wire) will produce an open shell (several joined faces)  
*  Extruding a closed Wire (e.g. a Draft Wire) will optionally produce a shell (several joined faces) or if the parameter "solid" is "true" will produce a solid 
*  Extruding a face (e.g. plane) will produce a solid (e.g. Cuboid)
*  Extruding a {{Button|[[File:Draft_ShapeString.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]]}} will produce a compound of solids (the string is a compound of the letters which are each a solid)
* Extruding a shell of faces will produce a Compsolid.

==Usage== <!--T:52-->

<!--T:6-->
# Optionally select one or more shapes in the [[3D_View|3D View]] or in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Extrude.svg|16px]] [[Part_Extrude|Extrude…]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Extrude.svg|16px]] Extrude…}} option from the menu.
# The '''Extrude''' [[Task_Panel|task panel]] opens.
#* Optionally click on an item in the '''Shape''' list to (re-) select a shape.
#* Optionally keep {{KEY|Shift}} pressed and click on an item in the '''Shape''' list to either add the shape to the selection, or to remove it from the selection.
#* Set the direction and length and optionally other parameters (see [[#Parameters|Parameters]] section for more details).
# Press {{Button|OK}} to close the task panel.
# One '''Extrude''' object will be created for each selected shape.

<!--T:8-->
Each input shape is placed underneath its Extrude object.

<!--T:25-->
* {{Button|OK}} button creates the extrusion, and closes the panel.

<!--T:26-->
* {{Button|Close}} button closes the panel, without doing anything.

<!--T:27-->
* {{Button|Apply}} button creates the extrusion, but does not close the panel. You can then select another shape from the list at the bottom and create more extrusions.

<!--T:28-->
* Direction radio buttons: sets the way the extrusion direction is computed.

* Reversed checkbox: reverses the extrusion direction.

<!--T:29-->
* {{Button|Select}} button: click it, and then pick an edge in the [[3D_View|3D View]]. That edge will appear in text field next to the button, in the format "ObjectName:EdgeN". You can also type the link manually or erase it. The values X, Y, Z will be filled according to the edge direction.

<!--T:30-->
* {{Button|X}}, {{Button|Y}}, {{Button|Z}} buttons: Click a button to set extrusion direction to the positive axis. Click it again to set it to the negative axis.

<!--T:31-->
* {{Button|X}}, {{Button|Y}}, {{Button|Z}} input fields: set or display the direction vector of extrusion. If both lengths are zero, the length of this vector sets the length of extrusion, and values are always in mm, regardless of unit preferences.

<!--T:32-->
* Length fields: set the length of the extrusion. These input fields have unit support.

<!--T:33-->
* Symmetric: spreads out the extrusion into both directions, so that the profile remains in the middle.

<!--T:34-->
* Taper angle along: draft angle for the along direction. Positive angle means profile is expanded at other end of extrusion.

* Taper angle against: idem for the against direction.

<!--T:35-->
* Create solid checkbox: if checked, extruding a closed wire or edge will yield a solid. It is checked by default, if a closed wire was preselected before invoking Part Extrude.

<!--T:36-->
* Shape list: here you select which shapes to extrude. If multiple objects are selected, multiple Extrude objects are created.

== Notes == <!--T:53-->

<!--T:54-->
* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types and [[App_Part|App Part]] containers with the appropriate visible objects inside can also be used as profiles and to specify the direction. {{Version|0.20}}

<!--T:37-->
* The task panel does not offer a preview, yet. {{Button|Apply}} will create an extrusion object every time you click it, which can be useful as preview; however, they will remain and yet another one will be created as you click {{Button|OK}}. [[Std_Undo|Undo]] can be useful to clean them up before clicking {{Button|OK}}.

== Comparison with PartDesign Pad == <!--T:40-->

<!--T:41-->
[[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]] is also an extrusion feature, but there are important differences:

<!--T:50-->
* Part Extrude always creates a standalone shape. PartDesign Pad fuses the extrusion result to the rest of the Body.
* Part Extrude can be placed anywhere in the model tree. PartDesign Pad can only be placed inside a [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]].
* Part Extrude can extrude any object that has a Part geometry ([[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE]] shape), except for solids and CompSolids.
* Part Extrude can extrude individual faces of other objects. PartDesign Pad will only accept either Sketch or faces of PartDesign objects as a profile.

== Properties ==

See also: [[Property_View|Property View]].

A Part Extude object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Extrude}}

* {{PropertyData|Base|Link}}: The shape to extrude.
* {{PropertyData|Dir|Vector}}: The extrusion direction. If {{PropertyData|Dir Mode}} is {{Value|Custom}} you can edit this property, otherwise it is read-only.
* {{PropertyData|Dir Mode|Enumeration}}: Sets how {{PropertyData|Dir}} is controlled. {{Value|Custom}} means {{PropertyData|Dir}} is editable. {{Value|Edge}} means {{PropertyData|Dir}} is obtained from an edge (line) linked by {{PropertyData|Dir Link}}. {{Value|Normal}} means  {{PropertyData|Dir}} is perpendicular to the plane of the input shape.
* {{PropertyData|Dir Link|LinkSub}}: Parametric link to an edge (line) that sets the extrusion direction.
* {{PropertyData|Length Fwd|Distance}}: Length of extrusion along direction. If both {{PropertyData|Length Fwd}} and {{PropertyData|Length Rev}} are zero, the length of the {{PropertyData|Dir}} vector is used.
* {{PropertyData|Length Rev|Distance}}: Length of additional extrusion, against direction.
* {{PropertyData|Solid|Bool}}: If true, extruding a closed edge or a closed wire will yield a solid. If False, a shell will result.
* {{PropertyData|Reversed|Bool}}: Reverses the extrusion direction.
* {{PropertyData|Symmetric|Bool}}: If true, extrusion is centered at the input shape, and the total length is {{PropertyData|Length Fwd}}. {{PropertyData|Length Rev}} is ignored.
* {{PropertyData|Taper Angle|Angle}}: Applies an angle to the extrusion, so that sides of the extrusion are drafted by the specified angle. Positive angle means the cross-section expands. Inner structures receive the opposite taper angle. This is done to facilitate the design of molds and molded parts.
* {{PropertyData|Taper Angle Rev|Angle}}: Sets the taper for the reversed part of the extrusion (the part from {{PropertyData|Length Rev}}).
* {{PropertyData|Face Maker Class|String|Hidden}}: Superseded by {{PropertyData|Face Make Mode}} (read-only).
* {{PropertyData|Face Make Mode|Enumeration}}: If {{PropertyData|Solid}} is true, the facemaker class to use when converting wires to faces, otherwise ignored. The options are {{Value|Simple}}, {{Value|Cheese}}, {{Value|Extrusion}} and {{Value|Bullseye}} (default).
