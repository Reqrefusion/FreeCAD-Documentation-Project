== Working through tutorial. FC 1.0.2   2025-11-13 ==

''Download the sample file'' - works

''Open default page - mmm''. For my fresh install the default page is completely blank. would be more helpful to direct to the next door button 'open from template' with a note saying where the templates install to, and/or a download link for the tutorial one. 

I cannot find which of the templates is the one in the tutorial. Not a big deal, but it makes me nervous about the next error...

# ''Select Page in the [[Combo view]] and scroll to the Scale property on the Data tab.''
# ''Change the Scale from 1 to 2 and press Enter. The View will get bigger.''

On my install, on any template page I have tried the view does not get bigger. I get the error "Pocket001: Removing splitter failed" instead.

''Click on  [[TechDraw VerticalDimension]].''  Took me a second to find it as hidden under the 'Insert Dimension' button options. Knew to look for it there based on previous software. 

Dimensions are coming through fine except at 1/2 scale compared to tutorial images for obvious reasons.

=== ''Editable Text  - Click on the small green square beside'' ===
No small green square in my view. It's a RMB click on the text.

''Click on  [[TechDraw ToggleFrame]].''  works fine
