==Description==

Inserts a subtractive prism in the active Body. Its shape is subtracted from the existing solid.

[[File:PartDesign_SubtractivePrism_example.svg|none]]

''On the left: active body (A) shown in grey and subtractive prism (B) shown in transparent red; result on the right.''

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:PartDesign_SubtractivePrism.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_SubtractivePrism|Subtractive Prism]]}} button. '''Note''': the Subtractive Prism is part of an icon menu labelled ''Subtractive Primitive''. After launching FreeCAD, the Subtractive Box is the one displayed in the toolbar. To get the Prism, click on the down arrow besides the visible icon and select Subtractive Prism in the menu.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part Design → Subtractive Primitive → [[Image:PartDesign_SubtractivePrism.svg|16px]] Subtractive Prism}} option from the menu.
# Set the Primitive Parameters and [[Part_EditAttachment|Attachment]].
# Click {{Button|OK}}.
# A Prism feature appears under the active Body.

==Options==

It is possible to create skewed prisms by specifying angles in respect to the normal vector of the chosen attachment.

The Prism can be edited after its creation in two ways:
* Double-clicking it in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], or by right-clicking and selecting '''Edit Primitive''' in the context menu; this brings up the Primitive Parameters.
* Via the [[Property_View|Property View]].

==Properties==

* {{PropertyData|Attachment}}: defines the attachment mode as well as the Attachment Offset. See [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]].
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: label given to the Prism object. Change to suit your needs.
* {{PropertyData|Polygon}}: number of sides in the polygon cross-section of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|Circumradius}}: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle circumscribed radius] of the polygon cross-section of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|Height}}: height of the prism.
* {{PropertyData|First Angle}}: angle in first direction.
* {{PropertyData|Second Angle}}: angle in second direction.
