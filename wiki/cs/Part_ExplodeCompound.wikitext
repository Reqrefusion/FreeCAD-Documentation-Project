==Description== 

The [[Image:Part_ExplodeCompound.svg|24px]] '''Part ExplodeCompound''' command splits a compound of shapes, to make each contained shape (child) available as a separate object. The children are automatically put into a [[Std_Group|Group]] if there is more than one child.

It is semi-parametric: the shapes of the children will update as the source compound changes, but if the number of children in the compound is changed, the explosion will be either missing some shapes, or have redundant objects in an error state.

Placements of extracted shapes follow the placements of the originals, plus the Placement property of each child.

The command will also explode non-compound shapes into their lower-level constituents: compsolids into solids, solids into shells, shells into faces, faces into wires, wires into edges, edges into vertices.

==Usage==

# Select a single compound.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_ExplodeCompound.svg|16px]] [[Part_ExplodeCompound|Explode Compound]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Compound → [[Image:Part_ExplodeCompound.svg|16px]] Explode Compound}} option from the menu.

==Use cases==

* Obtaining split pieces from result of [[Image:Part_Slice.svg|16px]] [[Part_Slice|Part Slice]] and [[Image:Part_Cut.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cut|Part Cut]]
* Obtaining individual contours from multi-contour sketches and faces
* Obtaining a pure solid from a solid-in-compound, for use in [[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|16px]] [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]].
