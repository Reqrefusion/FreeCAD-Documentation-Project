==Description==

Inserts a primitive cylinder in the active Body as the first feature, or fuses it to the existing feature(s).

[[File:PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder_example.png|200px]]

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder|Additive Cylinder]]}} button. '''Note''': the Additive Cylinder is part of an icon menu labelled ''Additive Primitive''. After launching FreeCAD, the Additive Box is the one displayed in the toolbar. To get the Cylinder, click on the down arrow besides the visible icon and select Additive cylinder in the menu.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part Design → Additive Primitive → [[Image:PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder.svg|16px]] Additive Cylinder}} option from the menu.
# Set the Primitive Parameters and [[Part_EditAttachment|Attachment]].
# Click {{Button|OK}}.
# A Cylinder feature appears under the active Body.

==Options==

It is possible to create skewed cylinders by specifying angles in respect to the normal vector of the chosen attachment.

The Cylinder can be edited after its creation in two ways:
* Double-clicking it in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], or by right-clicking and selecting '''Edit Primitive''' in the context menu; this brings up the Primitive Parameters.
* Via the [[Property_View|Property View]].

==Properties==

* {{PropertyData|Attachment}}: defines the attachment mode as well as the Attachment Offset. See [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]].
* {{PropertyData|Label}}: label given to the Cylinder object. Change to suit your needs.
* {{PropertyData|Radius}}: the radius value of the cylinder.
* {{PropertyData|Angle}}: angle of rotation of the cross section (360 degrees forms a full cylinder).
* {{PropertyData|Height}}: the height of the cylinder along its axis.
* {{PropertyData|First Angle}}: angle in first direction.
* {{PropertyData|Second Angle}}: angle in second direction.
