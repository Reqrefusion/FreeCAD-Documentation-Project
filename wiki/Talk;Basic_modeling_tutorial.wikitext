==v0.13: re: 2nd Method
The button described as "None" will probably not show up as "None".  The button label is set to the default working plane from Draft Preferences.  The button label could read: "top", "front", "side", "None" or a Vector representation such as d(0.0,0.0,1.0).  It can also be blank.

The button is located beside the "set shape colour, set line colour, ..." buttons.

The button does not have a tool tip ("Set Working Plane" perhaps?)

== Outdated labeling ==

I'm new to FreeCAD, so I might just be confused.

There's wording that seems to have changed since back when the article was written. For example, I believe the "Project" tab is currently labeled "Model", as well as "Data" is "Attachment". 

I don't want to make changes, so I'll wait for someone more familiar to clarify it or make edits. [[Special:Contributions/158.181.14.33|158.181.14.33]] 14:02, 1 September 2025 (UTC)
