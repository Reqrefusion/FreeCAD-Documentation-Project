Hello, I am Turan Furkan Topak. I'm working to keep this wiki synchronized with github, so I made a github repo that updates every 15 minutes. However, for synchronization, this is not enough and data must also be sent from GitHub to the wiki. This system is currently working and this article has been written to the relevant file on github.

To try this, you can make a PR offer to the relevant [https://github.com/Reqrefusion/FreeCAD-Documentation-Project github repo].
