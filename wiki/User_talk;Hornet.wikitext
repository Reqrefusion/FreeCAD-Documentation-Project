== Wire not closed ==

Followed the Basic Sketcher Tutorial and prepared to perform the Extrusion. It did not work - I kept getting an error message "Wire not closed"

The model is fully constrained.

Any suggestions? [[User:Hornet|Hornet]] ([[User talk:Hornet|talk]]) 16:42, 15 October 2025 (UTC)

:After the model was fully constrained I should have removed the construction lines. The extrusion worked OK.  [[User:Hornet|Hornet]] ([[User talk:Hornet|talk]]) 17:06, 15 October 2025 (UTC)
::I'm glad to hear but this place is there for documentation. Since it is your page, you can use it however you want, but you will not get a response from anyone but me. I don't know much either. How about trying the forum or Discord. [[User:Reqrefusion|Reqrefusion]] ([[User talk:Reqrefusion|talk]]) 22:13, 15 October 2025 (UTC)
