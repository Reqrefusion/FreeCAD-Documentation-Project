== Wire not closed ==

Followed the Basic Sketcher Tutorial and prepared to perform the Extrusion. It did not work - I kept getting an error message "Wire not closed"

The model is fully constrained.

Any suggestions? [[User:Hornet|Hornet]] ([[User talk:Hornet|talk]]) 16:42, 15 October 2025 (UTC)

:After the model was fully constrained I should have removed the construction lines. The extrusion worked OK.  [[User:Hornet|Hornet]] ([[User talk:Hornet|talk]]) 17:06, 15 October 2025 (UTC)
