== Description == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The [[Image:BIM_DrawingView.svg|24px]] '''BIM DrawingView''' tool creates a container object which is a specialized type of [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]] meant to hold 2D projection objects. 

When used in its typical workflow with an [[Image:Arch_SectionPlane.svg|16px]] [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch SectionPlane]], this tool automates the entire 2D extraction process. It automatically creates both the background projection lines (via [[Image:BIM_Shape2DView.svg|16px]] [[BIM_Shape2DView|BIM Shape2DView]]) and the solid section cuts (via [[Image:BIM_Shape2DCut.svg|16px]] [[BIM_Shape2DCut|BIM Shape2DCut]]), flattens them onto the XY plane, and groups them inside a single "Drawing" folder.

This grouped Drawing container can then be easily exported as a single 2D DXF or SVG file, or inserted as a single view onto a [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw]] page.

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

=== Automatic workflow ===

# Select a single [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch SectionPlane]] in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:BIM_DrawingView.svg|16px]] [[BIM_DrawingView|2D Drawing]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Annotation → Create 2D Views → [[Image:BIM_DrawingView.svg|16px]] 2D Drawing}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|V}} then {{KEY|D}}.
# A new "Drawing" object is created in the tree. Underneath it, you will automatically find two new 2D objects: "Viewed lines" and "Cut lines" (representing the projection and the cut fills, respectively).

=== Manual workflow ===

# Ensure nothing is selected.
# Invoke the tool using any of the methods described above.
# A new, empty "Drawing" container is created in the Tree view.
# You can manually drag and drop existing 2D shapes, Draft objects, or [[BIM_Shape2DView|Shape2DViews]] into this container to group them for export or drawing sheets.

==Properties==

The BIM DrawingView is essentially an [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]] with its {{PropertyData|IfcType}} set to {{Value|Annotation}} and its {{PropertyData|ObjectType}} set to {{Value|DRAWING}}. 

To keep the property panel clean for 2D drafting, several 3D-specific properties inherited from the BuildingPart (such as {{PropertyData|Height}}, {{PropertyData|Area}}, and {{PropertyData|LevelOffset}}) are hidden from the user interface.
