== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
The [[Status_Bar|Status Bar]] is a simple ribbon that appears at the bottom of the FreeCAD [[interface|interface]].

<!--T:3-->
When the mouse pointer is over a button or menu, the usage information of that command is displayed both in a textual popup and in the Status Bar.

<!--T:6-->
The Status Bar shows the [[Mouse_navigation|mouse navigation]] mode and the zoom level on the right. The zoom level gives the size of the current [[3D_View|3D View]] in appropriate units for the current scale, for example, millimeters (mm) or meters (m).

<!--T:7-->
The Status Bar also shows the last pre-selected object (any object under the pointer is pre-selected) or element of an object (vertex, edge, face), and the coordinates of the mouse pointer when the last pre-selection occurred; this is useful to know immediately the coordinate of specific vertices in your shapes. The 3D coordinates update automatically as long as the mouse pointer floats over a geometrical element; the update stops when the mouse pointer rests over an empty space in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

== Quick Measure == <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:12-->
The Quick Measure feature uses the right side of the Status bar to show measurements based on the selection in 3D view:
* Edge length
* Face area 
* Distance between points, edges or faces
* Angle between edges
* Radius of circular edges or cylindrical faces
* {{Version|1.1}}: Diameter of circles and cylindrical faces
* {{Version|1.1}}: Axis distance between circular elements and faces, edges or other circular elements

<!--T:13-->
{{Version|1.1}}: The feature can be disabled using the [[Std_Tools_Menu|Tools menu]] checkbox.
