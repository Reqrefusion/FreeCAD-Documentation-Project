== Introduction == <!--T:1-->

<!--T:2-->
The [[Status_Bar|Status Bar]] is a ribbon that appears at the bottom of the FreeCAD [[interface|interface]]. It can display several pieces of information and widgets. The BIM and Draft workbenches add their own widgets to the Status Bar. It is also possible to drag a toolbar into the Status Bar.

== Information and widgets ==

=== Usage information ===

<!--T:3-->
When the pointer is over a button or menu item, the usage information of that command is displayed in the Status Bar. This information is usually the same as the tooltip of the command.

=== Preselected information ===

<!--T:7-->
When the pointer is over an object in the [[3D_View|3D View]] the Status Bar shows the preselected element of the object as well as the current 3D coordinates. This information is updated as the pointer is moved over the object. The update stops when the pointer is over an empty space in the 3D View.
