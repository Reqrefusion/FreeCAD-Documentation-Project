==Description==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This is an algorithm that calculates thermal flow due to conduction and/or convection in one direction (e.g. a wall layered with various materials such as plaster, bricks and insulation, or a window with double glass and an enclosed cavity filled with air etc.). The phenomenon must be in steady state (i.e. not variable with time).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The input of the data must be written in a spreadsheet in [https://freecad.org FreeCAD] and the results are written in the same spreadsheet, a few lines below the last written row. This input data must include (in a specific order) the thermal properties of the materials of the layers that the thermal flow occurs, the thickness of each layer, the area, the temperature of the first and the last point in the direction of the thermal flow, the type of the phenomenon in each layer (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction conduction], or forced [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection convection], or free convection at a horizontal, vertical, inclined surface, or an enclosed cavity). The results are the heat flow rate (in Watts), the relative accuracy of the calculations (the algorithm uses thermal flow equations and solves the problem in iterations, trying to converge) and the calculated temperatures of the two surfaces on each layer.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Usage==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The following examples demonstrate how to use this script.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
===Example 1===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In this example, the heat flow rate that flows through a double glazed window, is calculated. It is given that the ambient air temperature inside the room is 25°C, and the ambient air temperature outside the window is 10°C. The size of the window is 0.57m height &times; 0.43m width (i.e. an area of 0.2451 m<sup>2</sup>). The thickness of each glass is 4mm (i.e. 0.004m) and the air gap in between is 16mm.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In order to use the algorithm, firstly, open the FreeCAD application. Then, select the [[Spreadsheet_Workbench|Spreadsheet Workbench]], create a new [[Image:Std_New.svg|16px]] [[Std_New|document]] and after that, create a new [[File:Spreadsheet_CreateSheet.svg|16px]] [[Spreadsheet_CreateSheet|spreadsheet]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
====Input data====
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The algorithm searches the first column of the spreadsheet, in order to find the first number. When it finds it, it assumes that this is the id of the first layer. It then searches for the id of the second layer. If five subsequent rows have not a number in the first column, then it assumes that there are not other layers. The rows in between the data of the layers can be used in order to write the units, comments etc. The properties of each layer must be written in a specific order.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
For this example, the data in the spreadsheet can be written as illustrated in the picture below.

Temp. 2 is the temperature of the outer surface of the outer glass and is roughly estimated to be 286.15K. This is an initial value for the solver to start the first iteration. This temperature will be calculated and presented in the results. In order to estimate an initial value, we used the following equation: (25 - 10) / 5 = 3, where 25°C is the indoor temperature, 10°C is the outdoor temperature and 5 are the number of the layers, so we added 3 to 283.15K.

====Executing the script====
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In order for the algorithm to run, you need to open the [[Python Console]] on FreeCAD, and execute the code below (i.e. copy-paste each line of the code below separately and press each time {{Button|Enter}}).
</div>

{{Code|lang=python|code=
import HeatFlowConvectionConduction
heatFlowObj = HeatFlowConvectionConduction.HeatFlowConvectionConduction()
heatFlowObj.calcHeatFlowConvectionConduction()
}}

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Please note that once you open FreeCAD, you need to copy-paste the first two lines of this code only once (the first line imports the script and the second line creates an object). Then, every time you want to execute the algorithm of the script (in order to read the data of the spreadsheet, run the solver, and present the results), just copy-paste the third line of the code above and then press {{Button|Enter}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The results are written in the same spreadsheet, three rows below the last written row (please have in mind that the algorithm checks only if the first ten columns in seven subsequent rows are empty, and if true, it considers that it has found “the last written row”).

The relative accuracy is 0.76% (the solver of the algorithm terminates if the relative accuracy is less than 5%, or the number of iterations are more than ten - you can change these limits by altering their values in the {{incode|simulate_thermal_flow}} function inside the script).
