== How assigning a material affects appearance ==

Assigning a material to an object primarily links its physical, engineering properties. However, it also affects the object's visual appearance, but with some important conditions.

=== Default behavior ===

In most cases, when a material is assigned to an object, the object's appearance will automatically update to match the visual properties (e.g., color, transparency), if they are defined in that material.

=== Exception: manual appearance overrides ===

There is one exception to the default behavior: he automatic appearance update will '''not occur if a manual appearance has been set on the object'''.

Any properties set using the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Std_SetAppearance.svg|16px]] [[Std_SetAppearance|Appearance]]}} command or the [[Property_View|Property View]] take priority over the appearance properties defined in a material. If an object's color does not change after assigning a material, it is likely because a manual appearance override is active.

==== Reverting an appearance override ====

See the how-to on [[Material_Workbench#Override_material_appearance|setting and reverting an appearance override]].

=== Materials without a defined appearance ===

Some materials in the library are defined only with physical properties and have no appearance properties. Assigning such a material will not change the object's appearance; it will retain its existing color and style.
