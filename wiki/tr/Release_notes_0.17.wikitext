== Önemli Noktalar ==

Önceki 0.16 sürümünden bu yana 2 yıl geçti, ancak FreeCAD ekibi bu süre boyunca boşta kalmadı. FreeCAD'in kaynak koduna 6.800'den fazla revizyon eklendi. Karşılaştırırsak bu, v0.16 ile 0.15 arasında yapılan işin üç katından fazla! Mevcut tezgahların çoğu iyileştirmelerden yararlanmış ve iki tamamen yeni tezgah eklenmiştir. Topluluk tarafından yeni ek modüller de geliştirilmiştir. Önemli noktalardan bazıları:


'''Parça tasarım tezgahı''' tamamen elden geçirildi. Yeni bir Cisim konteyneri şimdi bir özellikler zincirine sahip ve eskizlerin düzlemsel yüzlere eşlenmesi gerekliliğini kaldırdı. Noktalar, eksenler ve düzlemler gibi referans noktası (referans) geometrisi oluşturmak için yeni araçlar Parça tasarım tezgahını çok daha kullanışlı hale getirdi.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New set of [[Arch Pipe|piping tools]] to design piping systems. You can use lines, sketches or wires as a base to place tubes, and automatically create connections between 2 or 3 tubes.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The [[Arch Structure]] tool was extended with a series of new presets to build precast concrete elements.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

</div>
[[Image:Arch Door preview.png|640px]]
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Arch Axis]] tools have also been rewritten, and allow more complex systems by combining different series of axes together. They can also be customized to show different kinds of situations such as levels.
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* A new [[Arch Grid]] tool allows easily creating spreadsheet-like base objects by stretching, joining or splitting cells. These grid objects can then be used as axes systems, or as bases for complex window or panel arrangements.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New [[Arch Panel Cut|Panel tools]] were specifically designed for panel constructions. They allow building a model composed of [[Arch Panel|Arch Panels]], and then generating cutting sheets that can be used by the [[Path Workbench]] to generate cutting machine code.
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* A new [[Arch Nest|Nesting]] tool (still experimental), allows composing cut sheets by automatically placing 2D shapes in a containing shape.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Arch MultiMaterial|Multi-materials]] have been introduced in the Arch workbench. They allow automatically creating multilayer walls, or control the different materials of compound objects such as windows.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Draft_Slope|Slope tool]]: When used on a [[Draft Line]] or [[Draft Wire]], this tool will allow you to give it a specific slope/inclination. That is, the intermediate and end points will get a lower Z value, so the whole object gets a constant inclination. This is useful to use Lines or Wires as bases for objects that need a precise inclination, such as roof panes or sewer pipes.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Draft_SetWorkingPlaneProxy|Working Plane proxies]]: When working with [[Draft SelectPlane|Draft working planes]], you often need to store working plane locations that you use often. This is now possible by placing one of these proxies in your document. It will remember the current working plane location, and can also restore the current view and/or objects visibility.
</div>
[[Image:Draft_WP_preview.png|640px]]
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Draft Stretch]]: The Draft workbench now has a stretch tool, that allows moving vertices of several Draft objects at once.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

== Parça Tezgahı ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The Open Cascade geometric modeling kernel was updated from 6.8.0 to 7.2.0 (actual OCC version may depend on platform/distro). This version brings a lot of bug fixes in Boolean operations, hidden line removal algorithm, as well as allowing new features to be added to the Part workbench.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New features: [[Part BooleanFragments|Boolean Fragments]], [[Part Slice|Slice]] and [[Part XOR|XOR]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Thanks to the new features above, composite solids (compsolids) can now be created in FreeCAD. They are of great use in FEM.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Part JoinConnect|Connect]] performance and reliability were improved, and the tool was made more versatile.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New feature: [[Part Offset2D|2D Offset]], to offset planar wires.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Enhancement: [[Part Extrude]] tool now supports parametric Normal direction, direction controlled by linked edge, reversing, 2nd length, 2nd taper angle, and symmetric. Also, Make Solid checkbox is now checked automatically if you open dialog and the selected object is a closed wire (e.g., a sketch).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Enhancement: [[Part Revolve]] tool now supports parametric link to revolution axis.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The new [[Part_EditAttachment|Part Attachment]] utility accessible from the ''Part → Attachment…'' menu can be used to attach most types of objects to other geometry parametrically.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The new [[Std Part|Part container]] can be used to group most types of shapes and to move them as a unit. It also contains standard planes and axes to attach objects to. It will serve as basis for the future Assembly workbench by providing a way to move parts around. It is available in all workbenches from a toolbar along with [[Std Group|Group]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== PartDesign workbench ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The PartDesign workbench received massive changes, the fruit of combined efforts from multiple developers over a period of 5 years.
</div>
[[Image:PartDesign017-teaser-motor-core.png|800px]]
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The new [[PartDesign Body|Body]] container holds a chain of PartDesign features making up a single contiguous solid. It also contains standard planes and axes to attach objects to. Thanks to the Body container, it is no longer necessary to map sketches to faces when adding features. This requirement was a major limitation of the old PartDesign, that could cause many models to break upon parameter changes. So, it is now recommended to avoid mapping sketches to faces whenever possible.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New additive and subtractive features: [[PartDesign_CompPrimitiveAdditive|Primitives]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveLoft|Loft]], [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|Sweep]], [[PartDesign_Thickness|Thickness]].

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New datum features, [[PartDesign_Plane|planes]], [[PartDesign_Line|lines]] and [[PartDesign_Point|points]] are useful for placing sketches, alignment, and serving as axes of revolution.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New automatic workbench switching between PartDesign and Sketcher. When creating a new sketch from within the PartDesign workbench, once the sketch attachment is set, the UI automatically switches to the Sketcher workbench and its tools in editing mode. When the sketch is closed, the UI switches back to the PartDesign workbench, and restores the view to its previous state. Thus the Sketcher tools were removed from the PartDesign toolbars to liberate space for the new PartDesign features.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Path Workbench==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The Path workbench has been massively overhauled in version 0.17. The overhaul saw the removal of all older HeeksCNC code and replacement of the libarea python wrapper with the new Path-Area module. As a result operations have gotten much more powerful, faster, with a simplified code base.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Support for 2.5D operations is complete including [[Path_Profile|contour]], [[Path MillFace|face-milling]], [[Path Pocket Shape|pocketing]], [[Path_Profile|profiling]], and [[Path Drilling|drilling]]
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

* Path can use [[Arch Panel]] as base object to group multiple parts together for 2D cutting.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Introduction of [[Path Job]]. The job is now a central object of the path workflow.  It organizes and coordinates multiple operations, tools, stock material, part orientation and alignment.  A customized Job can be saved as a 'Job Template' and re-used to streamline the setup of future jobs.  Job SetupSheets provide a mechanism to automate the configuration of depth and speed settings.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* All operations have a consistent task panel organization
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Sketcher Workbench ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Sketches can now be attached in a wide variety of ways, not only to flat faces as it used to be. Of particular importance is attachment perpendicular to edges, useful for making profiles for [[Part Sweep|sweeping]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* External geometry links are no longer limited to only the object the sketch is mapped to. Geometry from other sketches is supported. External geometry links can be created within a Part container, or a Body container, or even a whole project if Part and Body containers are not used.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Visibility automation: now, when you start editing a sketch, objects depending on it are automatically hidden to unclutter the view, and objects used for external geometry links are automatically shown; old visibilities are restored as you close the sketch.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New constraint continuous creation mode: constraint tools are now active even without any element selected. Press a constraint, then select objects to apply the constraint to.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New arc of hyperbola and arc of parabola creation tools.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New '''Carbon Copy''' tool to copy geometry from another sketch.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Virtual space switches all constraints to a different "virtual space", in effect hiding them from view.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Constraints List box includes ability to hide internal alignment, as well as individual hiding of constraints with a checkbox.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The Block constraint removes all degrees of freedom for a geometry element in place with the use of a single constraint. It should be particularly useful to work with B-Splines, which are cumbersome to constrain.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New Regular polygon with user defined number of sides.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

* Geometry style based rendering order allows reordering between normal, construction and external geometry. Useful when these type of geometry overlap.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The solver now automatically substitutes a combination of coincident constraint + tangent constraint with a point-on-point tangent constraint, as the former is an improper use that induces tolerance error that can cause further problems in the model. The user is advised of the substitution by a dialog which can be disabled in Sketcher preferences by unchecking "Notify automatic constraint substitutions".
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New tick box in edit mode task view "Avoid redundant auto constraints"

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[TechDraw Workbench|TechDraw]] is a new workbench for creating technical drawings that aims to replace the aging Drawing workbench. FreeCAD v0.17 is still shipped with the Drawing workbench so you can still open and edit your files containing Drawing pages, but Drawing will be phased out in a future release. Some of the exciting new stuff that TechDraw brings:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Most tools from the Drawing workbench have a TechDraw counterpart.
* Easier view creation and manipulation. Views can be grabbed by their border with the mouse and dragged on the page. Orthogonal views alignment can be locked.
