== Overview ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
These are libraries which FreeCAD uses as third party dependencies during compilation. They are usually [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading dynamically linked libraries] and have an extension {{incode|.so}} in Linux/MacOS and {{incode|.dll}} in Windows, and are accompanied by their header files {{incode|.h}} or {{incode|.hpp}} or similar. If a modified library is necessary, or a wrapper class is needed, the code of the modified library, or the wrapper, has to become part of the FreeCAD source code, and compiled together with it.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The dependencies need to be installed in the system before proceeding with compilation; see [[Compile_on_Linux|compile on Linux]], [[Compile_on_Windows|compile on Windows]], and [[Compile_on_MacOS|compile on MacOS]] for more information.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If you are compiling using Windows, consider using the [[#LibPack|LibPack]] instead of trying to install the libraries individually.

{{VeryImportantMessage|Python 2 became obsolete in 2019. Further development of FreeCAD will use exclusively Python 3; compatibility with Python 2 won't be tested, so old workbenches and macros that use this version will have to be updated or they may stop working. Please post on the [https://forum.freecad.org FreeCAD forum] if you encounter problems with Python 3.}}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Python is a popular all-purpose scripting language that is widely used in Linux and open source software. In FreeCAD, Python is used during compilation and also at runtime in different ways. It is used
* to write test scripts to test for different conditions, such as memory leaks, to ensure functionality of the software after changes, for post build checks, and test coverage tests,
* to write [[Macros|macros]] and macro recording,
* to implement application logic for standard packages,
* to implement auxiliary tools such as the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]],
* to implement entire workbenches like [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] and [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]],
* to dynamically load packages,
* to implement rules for design (knowledge engineering),
* to do fancy Internet interactions like work groups and PDM
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
On Linux, Python is usually already installed in your distribution. For Windows you can get a precompiled binary from [https://python.org Python.org] or use [https://activestate.com ActiveState Python], though it is harder to get the debug libraries from the latter one.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Python was chosen as the scripting language for FreeCAD for different reasons:
* It is more object oriented than Perl and Tcl.
* The code is more readable than Perl and Visual Basic.
* It is easier to embed in another application, unlike, say, Java.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In summary, Python is well documented, and it's easy to embed and extend in a C++ application. It is also well tested and has strong support from the open source community. Read more about Python and browse the official documentation at [https://python.org Python.org].

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The Boost C++ libraries are collections of peer-reviewed, open source libraries that extend the functionality of C++. They are intended to be widely useful across a broad spectrum of applications, and to work well with the C++ Standard Library. The Boost license is designed to encourage their use in both open source and closed source projects.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Due to their popularity and stability, many Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into the C++11 standard, and more are planned for inclusion in subsequent C++ standards.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In order to ensure efficiency and flexibility, Boost makes extensive use of templates. Boost has been a source of extensive work and research into generic programming and meta-programming in C++. Read more about Boost by visiting the [https://boost.org Boost homepage].

=== OpenCASCADE Technology ===
</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
'''Version:''' 6.7 or higher

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
'''License:''' version 6.7.0 and later are governed by the [https://www.opencascade.com/content/licensing GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 with additional exception]. Earlier versions use the [https://www.opencascade.com/content/occt-public-license Open CASCADE Technology Public License].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT) is a full-featured, professional grade CAD kernel. It was developed in 1993 and originally called CAS.CADE, by Matra Datavision in France for the Strim (Styler) and Euclid Quantum applications. In 1999 it was released as open source software, and since then it's been called OpenCASCADE.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
OCCT is a big and complex set of C++ libraries that provide functionality required by a CAD application:
* A complete STEP compliant geometry kernel.
* A topological data model and needed functions to work with shapes (cut, fuse, extrude, and many others).
* Standard import and export processors for files like STEP, IGES, VRML.
* A 2D and 3D viewer with selection support.
* A document and project data structure with support for save and restore, external linking of documents, recalculation of design history (parametric modeling) and a facility to load new data types as an extension package dynamically.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
There are two main versions of OpenCASCADE in existence in different Linux distributions. One is distributed by the original developers; it is known as OCCT, and is packaged under the names {{incode|occ}} or {{incode|occt}}. The other version is the "community edition", abbreviated OCE, and is normally found with the {{incode|oce}} name. FreeCAD can compile against either version, however, since 2016 FreeCAD recommends compiling against the official OCCT libraries rather than the OCE ones. The reason is that the community edition lacks important bug fixes and functions that make using FreeCAD better.

Qt is one of the most popular graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits available in the open source world. FreeCAD uses this toolkit to draw the interface of the program. For this, the Qt Designer application is very useful as it allows developers to quickly draw the dialogs and windows, export them as XML resource files, and then load these interfaces at runtime.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Shiboken is the Python binding generator that Qt for Python uses to create the PySide module, in other words, it is the system that is used to expose the Qt C++ API to the Python language.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The original Shiboken and PySide packages were meant to be used with Python 2 and Qt4; since these two versions are considered obsolete in 2019, please use Shiboken2 and PySide2, which work with Python 3 and Qt5. New development of FreeCAD is done with Python 3 and Qt5, so compatibility with Python 2 and Qt4 is not guaranteed after FreeCAD 0.18.

Coin3D is a high-level 3D graphics library with a C++ application programming interface. It uses scenegraph data structures to render real-time graphics suitable for all kinds of scientific and engineering visualization applications.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Coin3D is built on the industry-standard OpenGL immediate mode rendering library, and adds abstractions for higher-level primitives, provides 3D interactivity, and contains many complex optimization features for fast rendering that are transparent for the application programmer.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Coin3D is compatible with SGI's Open Inventor 2.1 API. This API has become the de facto standard graphics interface for 3D visualization in the scientific and engineering community. It has proved its worth since the year 2000 as a major building block in thousands of engineering applications around the world.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Coin3D (Open Inventor) is used as the 3D viewer in FreeCAD because the OpenCASCADE viewer (AIS and Graphics3D) has limitations and performance bottlenecks, especially with large-scale engineering rendering; other things like textures or volumetric rendering are not entirely supported by the OpenCASCADE viewer.
</div>
