This tutorial was originally written by Roland Frank (†2017, r-frank), and it was rewritten and re-illustrated by vocx.

This tutorial describes a method to create 3D text and use it with solid objects in the [[File:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]]. We will discuss how to
* insert outlined text with the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_ShapeString.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]]}} tool,
* extrude it to be a 3D solid with {{Button|[[File:Part_Extrude.svg|16px]] [[Part_Extrude|Part Extrude]]}},
* position it in 3D space using [[Placement|placement]], and {{Button|[[File:Draft_Move.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Move|Draft Move]]}} (it uses a sketch as auxiliary geometry), and
* engrave the text by applying a boolean {{Button|[[File:Part_Cut.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cut|Part Cut]]}}.

To use ShapeStrings inside the [[File:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]], the process is essentially the same as with the Part Workbench, but the ShapeString is placed inside the [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] to extrude it. Go to the end of this tutorial for more information.

The [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]] is used briefly to draw an auxiliary line. More information about the tools of this workbench can be found in
* [[Basic_Sketcher_Tutorial|Basic Sketcher tutorial]]
* [[Sketcher_Lecture|Sketcher Lecture]]

== Setup ==

1. Open FreeCAD, create a new empty document with {{MenuCommand|File → [[File:Std_New.svg|16px]] [[Std_New|New]]}}, and switch to the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]].
:1.1. Press the {{Button|[[File:Std_ViewIsometric.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewIsometric|View isometric]]}} button, or press {{KEY|0}} in the numerical pad of your keyboard, to change the view to isometric to visualize the 3D solids better.
:1.2. Press the {{Button|[[File:Std_ViewFitAll.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewFitAll|View fit all]]}} button whenever you add objects in order to pan and zoom the [[3D_view|3D view]] so that all elements are seen in the view.
:1.3. Hold {{KEY|Ctrl}} while you click to select multiple items. If you selected something wrong or want to de-select everything, just click on empty space in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

==Create the basic shape==

2. Insert a primitive cube by clicking on {{Button|[[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] [[Part_Box|Box]]}}.
:2.1. Select {{incode|Cube}} in the [[Tree_view|tree view]].
:2.2. Change the dimensions in the {{MenuCommand|Data}} tab of the [[Property_editor|property editor]].
:2.3. Change {{MenuCommand|Width}} to {{incode|31 mm}}.

3. Create a chamfer.
:3.1. Select the upper edge ({{incode|Edge6}}) on the front face of the {{incode|Cube}} in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
:3.2. Press {{Button|[[Image:Part_Chamfer.svg|16px]] [[Part_Chamfer|Chamfer]]}}.
:3.3. In the {{MenuCommand|Chamfer edges}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] go to {{MenuCommand|Selection}}, choose {{MenuCommand|Select edges}}. As {{MenuCommand|Chamfer type}} choose {{incode|Equal distance}}, then set {{MenuCommand|Length}} to {{incode|5 mm}}.
:3.4. Press {{Button|OK}}. This will create a {{incode|Chamfer}} object.
:3.5. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Chamfer}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab change the value of {{MenuCommand|Line Width}} to {{incode|2.0}}.

==Insert the ShapeString==

4. Switch to the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]].
:4.1. Make sure nothing is selected in the [[Tree_view|tree view]].
:4.2. Establish the working plane to XY (Top) by clicking on {{Button|[[File:Draft_SelectPlane.svg|16px]] [[Draft_SelectPlane|SelectPlane]]}} and pressing {{Button|[[File:View-top.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewTop|Top (XY)]]}}.

5. Insert the text "FreeCAD".
:5.1. Click on {{Button|[[File:Draft_ShapeString.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ShapeString|ShapeString]]}}.
:5.2. Change {{MenuCommand|X}} to {{incode|0 mm}}.

:5.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Z}} to {{incode|0 mm}}.
:5.5. Or press {{Button|Reset point}}.
:5.6. Change {{MenuCommand|String}} to {{incode|FreeCAD}}; change {{MenuCommand|Height}} to {{incode|5 mm}}; change {{MenuCommand|Tracking}} to {{incode|0 mm}}.
:5.7. Make sure {{MenuCommand|Font file}} points to a valid font, (e.g, {{incode|/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf}} or {{incode|C:/Windows/Fonts/arial.ttf}}). Press the ellipsis {{Button|...}} to open the operating system's dialog to find a font.
::{{Emphasis|Note:}} for more details about working with fonts please refer to the [[Draft_ShapeString#Notes|Draft ShapeString Notes]] section. 
:5.8. Press {{Button|OK}}. This will create a {{incode|ShapeString}} object.
:5.9. Recompute the document by pressing {{Button|[[File:Std_Refresh.svg|16px]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh]]}}.
:5.10. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|ShapeString}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab change the value of {{MenuCommand|Line Width}} to {{incode|2.0}}.
:5.11. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Chamfer}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab change the value of {{MenuCommand|Visibility}} to {{incode|false}}, or press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard. This will hide the object, so you can see the {{incode|ShapeString}} better.
:5.12. To see the ShapeString from above change the view by pressing {{Button|[[File:View-top.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewTop|Top (XY)]]}}, or {{KEY|2}} in the keyboard.
:5.13. To restore the view to isometric, press {{Button|[[File:Std_ViewIsometric.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewIsometric|View isometric]]}}, or {{KEY|0}} in the keyboard.

==Create the solid 3D text==

6. Switch back to the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]].
:6.1. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|ShapeString}}, then press {{Button|[[File:Part_Extrude.svg|16px]] [[Part_Extrude|Extrude]]}}.
:6.2. In the {{MenuCommand|Extrude}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] go to {{MenuCommand|Direction}}, choose {{MenuCommand|Along normal}}; in {{MenuCommand|Length}}, set {{MenuCommand|Along}} to {{incode|1 mm}}; also tick the {{MenuCommand|Create solid}} option.
:6.3. Press {{Button|OK}}. This will create an {{incode|Extrude}} object.
:6.4. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Extrude}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab change the value of {{MenuCommand|Line Width}} to {{incode|2.0}}.

==Insert auxiliary sketch for positioning==

Now we will draw a simple sketch that will be used as auxiliary geometry to position the ShapeString extrusion.

7. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Extrude}}, and press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard to make it invisible.

8. Switch to the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]].

9. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Chamfer}}, and press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard to make it visible.
:9.1. Choose the sloped face created by the chamfer operation ({{incode|Face3}}).
:9.2. Click on {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_NewSketch|NewSketch]]}}. In the {{MenuCommand|Sketch attachment}} dialog, select {{incode|FlatFace}}, and press {{Button|OK}}.
:9.3. The view should adjust automatically so that the camera is parallel to the selected face.
:9.4. Draw a horizontal line in a general position on top of the face. The length is not important; we are just interested in its position.
:9.5. Constrain the left endpoint to be {{incode|2.5 mm}} away from the local X axis and from the local Y axis, using {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX|ConstrainDistanceX]]}} and {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceY.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceY|ConstrainDistanceY]]}}.
:9.6. Since the sketch is just an auxiliary object, we don't need to have it fully constrained. You can do this if you wish by assigning a fixed distance, say, {{incode|20 mm}}, again with {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX|ConstrainDistanceX]]}}.
:9.7. Close the sketch.

==Positioning the solid text in 3D space==

10. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Extrude}}, and press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard to make it visible.

11. With {{incode|Extrude}} still selected, in the {{MenuCommand|Data}} tab of the [[property editor|property editor]], click on the {{MenuCommand|Placement}} value so the ellipsis button {{Button|...}} appears on the right and click on that button.
:11.1. Tick the option {{MenuCommand|Apply incremental changes}}.
:11.2. Change the {{MenuCommand|Rotation}} to {{incode|Rotation axis with angle}}; {{MenuCommand|Axis}} to {{incode|Z}} (by setting the {{incode|X}}, {{incode|Y}} and {{incode|Z}} values of the axis inputboxes to {{incode|0}}, {{incode|0}} and {{incode|1}} respectively, {{incode|Z}} is the third inputbox), and {{MenuCommand|Angle}} to {{incode|90 deg}}, then click on {{Button|Apply}}. This will apply a rotation around the Z-axis, and will reset the {{MenuCommand|Angle}} field to zero.
:11.3. Change the {{MenuCommand|Rotation}} to {{incode|Rotation axis with angle}}; {{MenuCommand|Axis}} to {{incode|Y}} (by setting the {{incode|X}}, {{incode|Y}} and {{incode|Z}} values of the axis inputboxes to {{incode|0}}, {{incode|1}} and {{incode|0}} respectively), and {{MenuCommand|Angle}} to {{incode|45 deg}}, then click on {{Button|Apply}}. This will apply a rotation around the Y-axis, and will reset the {{MenuCommand|Angle}} field to zero.
:11.4. Click on {{Button|OK}} to close the dialog.

12. Switch again to the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]].
:12.1. Switch to "Wireframe" draw style with {{MenuCommand|View → [[Std_DrawStyle|Draw style]] → [[File:DrawStyleWireFrame.svg|16px]] Wireframe}}, or press the {{Button|[[File:DrawStyleWireFrame.svg|16px]] [[Std_DrawStyle|Wireframe]]}} button in the view toolbar. This will allow you to see the objects behind other objects.
:12.2. Make sure the [[Draft_Snap|Draft Snap]] "Snap to endpoint" method is active. This can be done from the menu {{MenuCommand|Draft → Snapping → [[File:Draft_Snap_Lock.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Lock|Toggle On/Off]]}}, and then {{MenuCommand| → [[File:Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Endpoint]]}}, or by pressing the {{Button|[[File:Draft_Snap_Lock.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Lock|ToggleSnap]]}} and {{Button|[[File:Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Snap endpoint]]}} buttons in the Snap toolbar.

13. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Extrude}}.
:13.1. Click on {{Button|[[File:Draft_Move.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Move|Move]]}}.
:13.2. In the [[3D_view|3D view]] click on the upper left corner point of the {{incode|Extrude}} object (1), and then click on the leftmost point in the line drawn with the sketcher (2).
:13.3. If {{Button|[[File:Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Snap endpoint]]}} is active, as soon as you move the pointer close to a vertex, you should see that it attaches to it exactly.
:{{Emphasis|Note:}} if you have problems snapping to vertices, make sure only the {{Button|[[File:Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Snap endpoint]]}} method is enabled. Having multiple snapping methods active at the same time may make it difficult to select the right feature.
:13.4. The extruded text should now be inside the body of the {{incode|Chamfer}} object.

==Creating engraved text==

14. Switch back to the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]].
:14.1. Switch to "As is" draw style with {{MenuCommand|View → [[Std_DrawStyle|Draw style]] → [[File:DrawStyleAsIs.svg|16px]] As is}}, or press the {{Button|[[File:DrawStyleAsIs.svg|16px]] [[Std_DrawStyle|As is]]}} button in the view toolbar. This will show all objects with the normal shading and color.
:14.2. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Sketch}}, and press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard to make it invisible.

15. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]] select {{incode|Chamfer}} first, and then {{incode|Extrude}}.
:15.1. Then press {{Button|[[File:Part_Cut.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cut|Cut]]}}. This will create a {{incode|Cut}} object. This is the final object.
:{{Emphasis|Note:}} the order in which you select the objects is important for the cut operation. The base object is selected first, and the subtracting object comes at the end.
:15.2. In the [[Tree_view|tree view]], select {{incode|Cut}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab change the value of {{MenuCommand|Line Width}} to {{incode|2.0}}.

== Engraving 3D text with the PartDesign Workbench ==

A similar process as described above can be done with the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

# Create the {{Button|[[File:Draft_ShapeString.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]]}} first.
# Create a {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Body_Tree.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]}}, make it active, and add a base solid by adding primitives, or using a Sketch and extruding it with {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Pad.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]]}}.
# Move the {{incode|ShapeString}} object into the active body.
# Attach the {{incode|ShapeString}} object to one of the faces of the solid, or to a {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Plane.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign Plane|PartDesign Plane]]}}, using {{Button|[[File:Part_EditAttachment.svg|16px]] [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]]}}.
# Now create a {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Pad.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]]}} or a {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Pocket.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Pocket|PartDesign Pocket]]}} from the {{incode|ShapeString}}, in order to produce an additive or a subtractive [[PartDesign_Feature|feature]] of the base body, respectively.
