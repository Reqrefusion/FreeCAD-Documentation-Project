RE the first question - CAD companies that don't want you to open up their files in anything other than their software? Their days are numbered unless they change this practice.

The question is wrongly posed. Under the cloak of freedom and competition, technical innovations are created by individuals who, after achieving a dominant market power, form monopolies. The aim is to maintain these monopolies for their endless pursuit of profit, not to abolish them.

== What file formats should users ask for instead of DWG? ==

It's well and good to ask people to reject DWG files and ask for an alternative. It doesn't help them to actually do that though, because what should they ask for instead?

I walked this path a little ways, as somebody new to Freecad that needs to get a CAD drawing for an electric motor I'm buying. Should I ask for DXF? Probably not, that's just a different closed format. Wait, let's look for the list... unfortunately there's about 4 dozen entries on the list of file types Freecad could handle. I have no hope whatsover of being able to untangle that lot and pick the helpful one. [[Special:Contributions/41.164.27.3|41.164.27.3]] 07:54, 7 January 2026 (UTC)
