==Description== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:10-->
The [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree|Sketcher BSplineIncreaseDegree]] tool increases the degree (order) of [[B-Splines|B-splines]].

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:17-->
# Select one or more B-splines.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree|Increase B-spline degree]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Sketcher B-spline tools → [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree.svg|16px]] Increase B-spline degree}} option from the menu.
#* {{Version|1.0}}: Right-click in the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree.svg|16px]] Increase B-spline degree}} option from the context menu.

==Example== <!--T:28-->

<!--T:19-->
B-splines are basically a combination of [[B-Splines#B.C3.A9zier_curves|Bézier curves]] (nicely explained in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1MrrqBAl8 this] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXJylM2S72s this] video).

<!--T:20-->
In this cubic B-spline (degree 3) there are 3 segments, meaning 3 curves are connected at 2 knots.

<!--T:29-->
The degree is indicated by the number in the center. See [[File:Sketcher_BSplineDegree.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineDegree|Show/hide B-spline degree]].

{{Caption|B-spline with degree 3 and 2 knots that each have multiplicity 1.}}

<!--T:22-->
The outer segments each have 2 control points, the inner segment has none to ensure the knots have multiplicity 1. See [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity#Description|this page]] for an explanation about multiplicity.

<!--T:23-->
Increasing the degree to 4 will add control points without changing the shape of the B-spline:

<!--T:24-->
{{Caption|Same B-spline where the degree was changed from 3 to 4. Note that the knot multiplicity has also increased.}}

<!--T:25-->
From this result you cannot get back to the initial state of the B-spline by decreasing the degree. Some information is lost when the degree of a B-spline is changed. Decreasing the degree back to 3 leads to this:

<!--T:26-->
{{Caption|Same B-spline where the degree was changed back from 4 to 3. Note that the knot multiplicity has increased again. Depending on the B-spline, the algorithm to decrease the degree may add a lot of knots to preserve the shape as has happened here.}}

<!--T:27-->
Each segment now has 2 control points and each knot is coincident with an additional control point. The knots have ''C<sup>0</sup>'' continuity so that the B-spline will get "corners" if you move a control point. The information of a higher continuity is therefore lost. See [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity#Description|this page]] for an explanation about continuity.
