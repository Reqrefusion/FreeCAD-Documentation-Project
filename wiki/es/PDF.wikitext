== Descripción ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF Portable Document Format] (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text and images.

PDF is based on the PostScript language, which is a vector-based format to describe pages. In this sense it's similar to [[SVG|SVG]], as it allows scaling a drawing to any size without losing its shape or amount of details.

Nevertheless, a PDF can contain many things, including text, fonts, vector graphics, and [[bitmap|bitmap]] images. PDF was standardized as an open format in 2008, as ISO 32000.

PDF is commonly used as a sharing format, that is, to share documents, text, or images, that will display and print exactly as the author intended.

==Utilización==

As FreeCAD is based on the Qt graphical toolkit, it can export the [[3D_view|3D view]] natively to PDF. This can be useful to export carefully created drawings that other users don't need to modify. For example, pages created with the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] can be [[Std_Export|exported]] in this way for sharing or printing. In many cases it is also possible to perform two way conversion between PDF and [[SVG|SVG]].

The option to export to PDF is available in the {{MenuCommand|File → [[Std_Export|Export PDF]]}} menu.
