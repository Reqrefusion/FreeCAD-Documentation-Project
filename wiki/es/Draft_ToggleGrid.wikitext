==Description== 

The [[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|24px]] '''Draft ToggleGrid''' command changes the visibility of the grid.

{{Version|1.0}}: Each [[3D_View|3D View]] has its own grid that can either always be visible, only be visible during commands, or invisible. The initial visibility of the grid in new views depends on the [[#Preferences|preferences]].

==Usage==

# The command can be used while another command is active.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ToggleGrid|Toggle Grid]]}} button in the Draft Snap toolbar.
#* [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]]: Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|16px]] [[Draft_ToggleGrid|Toggle Grid]]}} button in the [[Draft_Snap_Widget|Draft Snap Widget]].
#* Draft: Select the {{MenuCommand|Utilities → [[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|16px]] Toggle Grid}} option from the menu, or from the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or [[3D_View|3D View]] context menu.
#* [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]]: Select the {{MenuCommand|Snapping → [[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|16px]] Toggle Grid}} option from the menu, or from the 3D View context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|G}} then {{KEY|R}}. This shortcut cannot be used if another command is active.
# The visibility of the grid belonging to the current 3D View has changed:
#* If no other command is active:
#** If the grid was invisible it is now always visible.
#** If the grid was visible it is now no longer always visible, but the grid's visibility during commands remains unchanged.
#* If another command is active:
#** If the grid was invisible it is now only visible during commands.
#** If the grid was visible it is now no longer visible during commands and no longer always visible.

==Preferences==
