==Description==

The [[Image:CAM_Job.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Job|Job]] tool creates a new Job object in the active document. The Job object contains the following information:
# A list of Tool-Controller definitions, specifying the geometry, Feeds, and Speeds for the Path Operations Tools. 
# A Workflow sequential list of Path Operations.
# A Base Body—a clone used for offset.
# A Stock, representing the raw material that will be milled to CAM Workbench.
# A SetupSheet, containing inputs used by the Path Operations, including static values and formulas.
# Configuration parameters specifying the output G-Code job's destination path, file name, and extension, and the [[CAM_Post|postprocessor]] (used to generate the appropriate dialect for the target CNC Controller, and customize Units, Tool Changes, Parking, etc.).

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:CAM_Job.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Job|CAM Job]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|CAM → [[Image:CAM_Job.svg|16px]] Job}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|P}} then {{KEY|J}}.

The Job GUI dialog box has five horizontally aligned tabs: {{MenuCommand|General}}, {{MenuCommand|Output}}, {{MenuCommand|Setup}}, {{MenuCommand|Tools}}, and {{MenuCommand|Workplan}}. The user can at any time utilize the {{Button|OK}} or {{Button|Cancel}} options within the dialog.

==General==

[[File:Job_1.jpg]]

* '''Label''': The label of the Job as displayed in the tree view.
* '''Model''': The Base Object which defines by its shape the paths of the job. If it is a Part Design object, it is usually the Body you select here. If you have an element selected in the tree ''before'' you click the "Add Job" icon that element is already entered here. You can change it by selecting a different element from the dropdown menu.
* '''Description''': You can add some notes to the job here. Notes are only for your information and have no effect on the path.

** '''%d''' name of the active document (without extension)
** '''%M''' user macro directory
** '''%j''' name of the job

* '''Processor''': Select the [[CAM_Post|postprocessor]] for your machine.

Add the tool(s) from your [[CAM_ToolLibraryEdit|Tooltable]] that you need for the operations at this job.

After adding a tool, you can set/change the feedrate and spindle speed if you need a different feedrate in this job. 
A change here doesn't change the parameters stored in the tooltable. 

You can delete the default tool if you have your own tool added.

<span id="Workplan"></span>

If you have a job that contains more than one path operation, you can determine in which order the operations should be done.
To reorder, select an operation and push the up or down button.
