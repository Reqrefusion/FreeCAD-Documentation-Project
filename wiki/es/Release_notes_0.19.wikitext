| Preliminary design of MAORY, an adaptive optics (AO) module for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT); here it is mounted on the E-ELT Nasmyth platform.

This assembly was made by "Zolko", author of the new [[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4 Workbench]], which uses the new powerful [[App_Link|App Link]] object to import thousands of different parts and subassemblies, arranging them in specified positions by means of mathematical expressions. See [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=42624 Users Showcase].

For this model, the parts were not designed in FreeCAD, they were just imported in STEP format, and subsequently arranged with Assembly4.

| Constant velocity joint M. GECIK, by user "ppemawm", see [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&p=379220#p377075 Users Showcase]. The model is reversed engineered from the individual STL files from Thingiverse by the original author, [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4191753 NOP21]. Please notice the license of the original files.

The STL files were downloaded, saved, and imported into FreeCAD, and they were manually assembled using the [[Std_TransformManip|Std TransformManip]] tool; this [[mesh|mesh]] [[assembly|assembly]] was used as reference to create solid [[Body|bodies]] with [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign]] and subsequently assemble them using the new [[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4 Workbench]].

The model was started with Assembly4, and each part was created in-context referencing the STL model for [[sketch|sketch]] dimensions; sketches were created 1:1 scale with the STL model in the background.

| The [[File:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]], which replaced the [[File:Workbench_Drawing.svg|24px]] [[Drawing_Workbench|Drawing Workbench]] in [[Release_notes_0.17|v0.17]], has been upgraded in an important way. It has many new features with respect to [[Release_notes_0.18|v0.18]], which make it much more useful to produce technical illustrations of 3D solids.

Among many small improvments, new features include: dimensions are now compliant with one of ISO 129-1 or ASME Y14.5M standards; new [[TechDraw_Balloon|balloon annotations]] to include text inside a circle or polygon shape; new [[TechDraw_RichTextAnnotation|rich text annotations]] to include big paragraphs formatted as bold or italic; [[TechDraw_CosmeticVertex|cosmetic vertices]] and [[TechDraw_FaceCenterLine|cosmetic edges]] that are not part of the original model but which can be used to create custom dimensions; basic support for [[TechDraw_WeldSymbol|welding symbols]]; new [[TechDraw_ActiveView|active view]] mode to take a "snapshot" of the [[3D_view|3D view]]; new basic templates for ISO sizes (A0 to A4), as well as Russian and Chinese language templates; new horizontal and vertical dimensions that measure the [[TechDraw_HorizontalExtentDimension|full extent of the projections]]; SVG face hatches are now available when the page is exported to SVG; the new [[App_Link|App Link]] object is now also supported as a source for creating views, which is useful when working with [[assembly|assemblies]].
|}

== General ==

With more than 8128 commits in the master branch since the 0.18 release, this is one of the most extensive releases ever, with several new components like the new "[[App_Link|App::Link]]" object, as well as many new tools in the [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] that make FreeCAD even more powerful for 3D solid modelling and assembly. Beside that, the FreeCAD ecosystem has continued to grow with more specialized [[external_workbenches|external workbenches]].

=== Python 3 y Qt5 ===

The effort to migrate from Python 2 and Qt4 to Python 3 and Qt5 is essentially complete and most developers have moved to the Python3/Qt5 toolchains.

Undoubtedly there are unforeseen bugs; these will be addressed as they are reported. Any existing dependence on Python 2 or Qt4 will not be supported beyond 1st January 2020 when Python 2 officially became unsupported by the Python Foundation. Please note that certain addons have not been ported yet to Python3/Qt5. This may be due to several reasons including lack of time by their developers, or broken dependencies that may not be easily fixed, or simply because the addon is considered obsolete. Individuals interested in the migration of a particular workbench or tool are encouraged to participate in the [https://forum.freecadweb.org/ FreeCAD forum]; see also, [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=30624 Python3 and Qt5 Compatible Addon Workbenches (in preparation for 0.18)].

* The infrastructure of the bug tracker as well as wiki was moved to a dedicated server, so that it is easier to manage by the project administrators; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=42795 forum discussion].

<span id="Documentation"></span>
=== Documentación ===

* The [[Compile_on_Linux|Compile on Linux]] page was reviewed to better explain the requisites to compile on different Linux distributions. As many developers use Debian based systems, this section received the most attention. Users of other Linux distributions are encouraged to maintain the documentation for their particular distribution.
* [[Compile_on_Windows|Compile on Windows]] was also rewritten to explain how to use the "LibPack" for compilation.
* [[Compile_on_Docker|Compile on Docker]] was created to describe the compilation in this system.
* The [[Source documentation|Source documentation]] page also received a clean-up to better explain how to produce the programming (API) documentation from C++ and Python sources.
* The [[Doxygen|Doxygen]] page was reviewed and extended to give more details about the syntax that is used in C++ files to produce the programming documentation.
* The [[Source code management|Source code management]] page was also reworked with better descriptions and examples of using {{incode|git}} to manage branches and contribute code.
* The [[External workbenches|External workbenches]] page was re-organized, so that all feature-rich, publicly available workbenches are listed. If you'd like to add a workbench to this page, showcase it in the forum, and provide supporting information like user manual, wiki pages, and a link to its repository. Then push for it to be included in the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].
* There have been improvements to the [[Tutorials|Tutorials]] and [[Video tutorials|Video tutorials]] pages. In particular, it has been stressed to readers that they should consider only video tutorials that are made with versions 0.17 and above.

== App::Link and assembly ==

<!-- This is not a typo, the "x" indicates the height of the image, like WxH. In this case the width is omitted so only the height is set.

{{Caption|The "App::Link" object allows lightweight linking of objects in a document and from external documents.}}

After 2.5 years in development, the "[[App Link|Link]]" object, or more formally [[App_Link|App Link]] ({{incode|App::Link}} class), was introduced in FreeCAD. This is a special type of [[App_DocumentObject|App DocumentObject]] with certain properties that will hopefully allow for doing assemblies easier.

An "[[App_Link|App Link]]" allows objects to use another object's data, such as geometry or even their 3D visual representation, in the same or different files. It can be thought of as a thin, absolute clone, or as the same object living into two different "instances". Some functionality offered by an "App Link" is already present in some workbenches like [[Arch_Workbench|Arch]] and [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] ([[Draft_Clone|clones]], [[Arch_Reference|external references]]), but the "App Link" implementation is at the core level, and thus can be used by all workbenches in different ways.

The "[[App_Link|App Link]]" component was thought and developed almost single-handedly by user {{emphasis|realthunder}}. The motivations and design implementations behind this project are described in his GitHub page, [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Link Link]. In order to accomplish this feature, several core changes to FreeCAD were made; these are also extensively documented in [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes Core-Changes].

The history of "App Link" can be traced to some essential forum threads:
*[https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=21505 Why an object can only be inside one App::Part?] (March 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21586 Introducing App::Link/XLink] (March 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=22216 Links] (May 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=23015 Realthunder Link implementation: Architecture discussion] (June 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=23419 PR #876: Link, stage one, context aware selection] (July 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=23626 Preview: Link, stage two, API groundwork] (July 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=25712 Assembly3 preview] (December 2017)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=29542 Merging of my Link branch] (June 2018)

Finally, the pull request and merge happened:
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=38621 App::Link: the big merge], old thread (July 2019), [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2350 pull request #2350] (the BIG merge), [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/tree/LinkMerge LinkMerge branch].

* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=329054#p329054 A simple path description of Link, 019, Link stage, Asm3, merge?] (August 2019)
* [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=39672 PR#2559: expose link and navigation actions], an introduction to the Link feature in 0.19 (September 2019).

The "App Link" object prepares FreeCAD for the phase that was scheduled to happen after the redesign of [[Release_notes_0.17|PartDesign in FreeCAD 0.17]], which is working with assemblies. 

[[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]] is an assembly workbench written in Python by realthunder, that makes use of the "App Link" functionality. The workbench served as a testbed for this component during its development. While Assembly3 is still not officially part of FreeCAD, with the inclusion of "App Link" in the master branch, it is a matter of time for Assembly3 to be provided as an installable add-on, just like [[A2plus Workbench|A2plus]] and [[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4]] are provided currently.

== Core system, App, Base, and Gui namespaces ==

Beside the introduction of [[App_Link|App Link]], the "LinkMerge" branch also introduced some changes visible to the user with regards to object properties, [[Expressions|expressions]], [[Selection_methods|visual selection]], and the [[tree_view|tree view]]. These are described in the [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes Core-Changes] page.

The section plane generates an SVG that is simply displayed in a TechDraw page; with these new modes, the SVG generation is performed by Coin, so it is faster than using {{Value|Wireframe}} and {{Value|Solid}}, which use the internal OCCT kernel to calculate the SVG projection. The tradeoff is between speed and precision; the Coin modes are faster but less precise, while the original modes are more precise but relatively slow.

| After half a year in development and testing the "femconcrete" branch was added to the FEM Workbench. This provides tools to estimate the level of reinforcement required in a concrete structure to prevent brittle failure under tension or shear. In essence, it is a post processing routine for the CalculiX solver, which calculates the principal tensile stresses in the concrete from an elastic analysis and uses those to determine the minimum reinforcement in the three coordinate directions required to prevent failure.

| [[File:fcFEM_Plate_with_Hole_2.png|384px]]
| After a few months in development the "fcFEM" macro was published. It implements a finite element solver entirely in Python. Its author designed it to overcome the limitations of other external solvers, like CalculiX and z88. Some of the intended improvements include creating mixed mesh analyses, improved beam and shell elements,  arc-length control for overcoming limit points in elastic-plastic analyses, implementation of zero-thickness interface elements for different applications, and others.

In due time this solver could be distributed together with the FEM Workbench, meaning that the FreeCAD project would have its own finite element solver for doing mechanical and structural analyses.

| [[Mesh_FromPartShape|Mesh FromPartShape]] is now able to create [[mesh|meshes]] using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmsh Gmsh]. This mesher is an external program that must be installed in the system before it can be used. Gmsh was already one of the options to create [[FEM_Mesh|finite element meshes]] with the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]].

Moreover, now the [[Mesh_FromPartShape|Mesh FromPartShape]] dialog will remember the settings that you used the last time.

== Spreadsheet Workbench ==

The introduction of [[App_Link|App Link]] also brought some improvements to the [[expressions|expressions]] capabilities of FreeCAD, which are visible in the [[property_editor|property editor]], and the [[Spreadsheet_Workbench|Spreadsheet Workbench]]. These are described in [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Core-Changes Core-Changes] and this [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=38974 forum thread].
* A new expression syntax is introduced to unambiguously reference a property of the owner object, by omitting the object reference and starting with a leading dot ({{incode|.}}), similar to Python relative import syntax. So instead of {{incode|Cylinder.Height}}, now you can use {{incode|.Height}}.
* You can refer to an object by its {{incode|Name}} or by its {{incode|Label}}. In the case of a {{incode|Label}}, it must be enclosed in {{incode|<<}} and {{incode|>>}} symbols, such as {{incode|<<Label>>}}. For example, {{incode|<<Metal_cylinder>>.Height}}.
* Improved spreadsheet recomputation logic, and cell copy and paste functions. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2350 Pull request #2350], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2475 #2475].

The previous commits changed the way the autocompletion works with [[expressions|expressions]], particularly when used with [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher]] constraints, which was seen as a regression for many use cases. A new set of commits were proposed to restore this functionality; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=43412 forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/3062 pull request #3062].

=== Further TechDraw Improvements ===

* There has been discussions about changing the standard behavior of TechDraw. Instead of keeping the drawing pages updated automatically, they would be updated only on demand; this would mitigate the effects of TechDraw slowing down the rest of FreeCAD when modelling. Moreover, now that [[App_Link|App Link]] is included in FreeCAD, TechDraw pages may be stored in a separate file, and loaded on demand; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=35086 forum discussion] (main discussion), [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38822 forum discussion] (alternatives).
* Improvements on the handling of sectional views with [[TechDraw SectionView]]; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=40639 Forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2737 pull request #2737].
* Fixed font size issues when exporting to SVG; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=27108 forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2219 pull request #2219].
* Fixed regression in caption handling and hide caption property where not applicable; [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2228 pull request #2228].
* Added options for page size, line width and background when saving to SVG; this improves Draft/Arch and TechDraw integration; [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2455 pull request #2455].
* New panning of the page using the middle mouse button; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=29679#p327695 forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2458 pull request #2458].
* Finer control of drawing updates; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38956 forum discussion], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2468 pull request #2468], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/5bed53f858 commit 5bed53f858], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/b2d8eeeb65 commit b2d8eeeb65].
* Also new [[TechDraw_RedrawPage|TechDraw RedrawPage]] tool to force a drawing page update while ignoring the state of the options "Update with 3d", "Allow page override", or "KeepUpdated". This tool disappeared in 0.18, but was re-implemented for 0.19; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=38956 forum discussion].
* The new [[App_Link|App Link]] object is now supported as a source for creating views; [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=41973 forum discussion], [http://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/commit/37b578bf49 commit 37b578bf49].
* The center marks created from circular edges, can now be printed; [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2335 pull request #2335], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/2962 #2962].
* It is now possible to override displayed values for tolerances, for example to use text in tolerances. Furthermore, one can now use a custom display format for each, over- and undertolerance. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4087 pull request #4087]
* The [[TechDraw_LineGroup|LineGroup]] to set the default line widths for drawings can now be selected from the available groups in the [[TechDraw_Preferences#Annotation|preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/4083 pull request #4083]

== Web ==

* QtWebEngine support for Qt 5.7 and above, and fallback to QWebkit for Qt 5.6 and below; [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/1937 pull request #1937].

=== Assembly3 ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Assembly3_0.19.png|384px]]
| [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]] is an assembly workbench created by developer {{Emphasis|realthunder}}, that is inspired by [[Assembly2_Workbench|Assembly2]], but is not compatible with it. Assembly3 makes use of realthunder's [[App_Link|App Link]] object and various significant changes to the internal code of FreeCAD. Because of this reason, Assembly3 cannot be installed simply from the Addon Manager. Instead, realthunder provides a pre-compiled version of FreeCAD that includes Assembly3. This workbench serves as a testing environment for the [[App_Link|App Link]] object, and other changes that realthunder plans to submit to the main FreeCAD source code.

The Assembly3 workbench can also be tested in the development [[AppImage|AppImage]].

=== Assembly4 ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:Assembly4_0.19.png|384px]]
| [[Assembly4_Workbench|Assembly4]] is an assembly workbench created by developer {{Emphasis|Zolko}}, that uses realthunder's [[App_Link|App Link]] object and many other changes to the base FreeCAD system, particularly the new [[expressions|expression engine]]. Because of this, Assembly4 doesn't work with versions below 0.19. Assembly4 can be installed from the [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

Unlike [[A2plus_Workbench|A2plus]] and [[Assembly3_Workbench|Assembly3]], Assembly4 tries to perform assembly without using a constraint solver, but rather with the concept of arranging local coordinate systems (LCS) and setting relationships through [[expressions|mathematical expressions]].

=== ArchTextures ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:ArchTextures_0.19.png|384px]]
| The ArchTextures Workbench was developed to provide basic texture support to [[Arch Workbench|Arch Workbench]] elements like walls and roofs, in order to quickly visualize a building. It is not intended to produce photo-realistic renderings, just simple texturing of materials like wood, brick, and concrete. It also provides lights (directional, point, and spot), which makes it more feature complete to set up a scene.

=== BOLTSFC ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:BOLTSFC_0.19.png|384px]]
| BOLTS is an "open library of technical specifications"; it is meant to provide free, standardized parts defined parametrically that can be used in different CAD systems like OpenSCAD and FreeCAD. The BOLTS library was launched in 2013 but received little maintenance since 2016. Now, with a new maintainer and repository, the project has revived with the BOLTSFC workbench that provides an interface to insert the different parametric objects.

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:FlamingoBlob.png|384px]]
| Dodo is the successor to the [[Flamingo Workbench|Flamingo Workbench]], a workbench specialized in creating piping and frames. While Flamingo was developed for Python 2 and Qt4, Dodo is meant to work with Python 3 and Qt5. It provides the same features as Flamingo, but has improved tools and interfaces.

=== MeshRemodel Workbench ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:MeshRemodel_Workbench_0.19.png|384px]]
| This workbench helps convert a mesh, for example, an imported STL file, into a native FreeCAD object. It will not do the conversion automatically, but it will help re-build, or re-model, the imported mesh. The general workflow is to select the mesh object, then create a "points" object from it; then these points can be used as references for creating FreeCAD objects such as lines, polygons, circles, arcs, and BSplines. These wires can then be turned into a [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketch]] object, which can be padded to create a 3D solid with the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

=== NodeEditor (PyFlow) ===

{|cellpadding=5
| [[File:NodeEditor_0.19.png|384px]]
| The NodeEditor workbench implements a system of nodes that can be used to dynamically control the properties of objects, similar to Blender's node system to edit materials. The NodeEditor is based on a slightly modified version of the PyFlow framework, which is under active development.

A node editor has been a requested feature for a very long time, at least since 2014 (see [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7442 this thread]). A fully working node editor has the potential of simplifying the drawing of complex shapes using generative algorithms that produce a shape based on the values of its inputs. This could be used to create various types of meshes and surfaces with many applications in architecture and mechanical design.

| The '''Trails''' workbench was formerly known as the "Transportation Engineering" workbench. It consists of a toolset for developing highway and railway designs, including horizontal alignments, vertical profiles, and 3D models.

[https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6973 Forum discussion] (original thread that started the project), [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=22277 forum discussion] (main thread, very long); [https://github.com/joelgraff/freecad.trails freecad.trails] repository (LGPL 2.1), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRTd7056yy8&feature=youtu.be video example].

Most of the functions used in the Trails workbench have been placed in a new Python library called '''PyTrails'''. The expectation is that Trails serves as a FreeCAD based graphical interface for PyTrails, while PyTrails remains a general purpose library that can be used outside FreeCAD in other projects.

| The '''Turns''' workbench is a small component that was created during development of the Trails workbench. It performs vehicle swept-path analysis (turning analysis) for highway intersections and other entrances.

| After working with Trails and Turns, the author decided to split the tracker code into a separate library called '''pivy_trackers'''. This is a general library that could be included in other workbenches to generate tracker objects and perform actions in the scene, like dragging lines, dragging points, and changing certain geometrical elements on the fly.

| [[File:Geomatics_Workbench_0.19.png|384px]]
| The '''Geomatics''' workbench provides functionality specific to survey engineering, such as importing geodata information, and creating surfaces from clouds of points. There are some issues with rendering objects that use large coordinates (kilometers) and importing large DXF files. If you want to help solving these issues, please contact the developers.

This workbench started as a fork of the older [https://github.com/microelly2/geodata Geodata] workbench by microelly2. Eventually it became a separate project by HakanSeven12. Now its code has been merged into the '''Trails''' workbench as it provides complementary functions to it. Therefore, in the future, please use Trails instead of the older Geomatics repository.
