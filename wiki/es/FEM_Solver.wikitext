На этой странице собрана вся информация о решающей системе FEM, используемой FreeCAD [[FEM Workbench|FEM Workbench]]. Интерфейс между решателем и FreeCAD в предварительной и последующей обработке выполняется с помощью текстовых файлов. Теоретически это означает, что любой решатель, использующий текстовые файлы, способен работать вместе с FreeCAD FEM.

This page collects information on the finite element solvers used by the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]]. The interface between a solver and FreeCAD in pre-processing as well as post-processing is done through text files. This means that in theory, any solver which can be configured and controlled by means of text files is able to work together with FreeCAD; a proper parser and writer of input and output files needs to be programmed for this communication to work. A forum topic to discuss and announce anything regarding the various solvers can be found here: [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=26326 General FEM solvers discussion topic].
