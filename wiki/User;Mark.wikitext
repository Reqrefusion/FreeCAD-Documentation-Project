My name is Mark Sims, president of [http://www.nanorex.com/ Nanorex, Inc.].

FreeCAD has piqued my curiousity since Nanorex is working on an OpenSource parametric modeling (MCAD) system called [http://ww.nanoengineer-1.net NanoEngineer-1 (aka NE1)] for nanoscale design. NE1 is based on [http://www.trolltech.com Qt (4.0)] and Python, just like FreeCAD.

I'd like to learn more about FreeCAD and explore the possibility of joining forces since there are many goals we have in common.

A FreeCAD journal I'll be maintaining.

* Downloaded FreeCAD for Windows XP. Install was a snap. No problems with startup.
* When attempting to download online help, I got the error:
:: <font color=red>Cannot find host 'free-cad.sourceforge.net'</font>
* Many similarities in UI layout with NE1.
