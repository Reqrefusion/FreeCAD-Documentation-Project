==Introduction== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
While a sketch is being edited, or, in other words, while a sketch is in edit mode, the Sketcher Dialog is displayed on the Tasks tab of the [[Combo_View|Combo View]].

<!--T:40-->
To put a sketch in edit mode  see [[Image:Sketcher_EditSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_EditSketch|Sketcher EditSketch]]. To finish edit mode see [[Image:Sketcher_LeaveSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_LeaveSketch|Sketcher LeaveSketch]].

<!--T:4-->
The Sketcher Dialog has the following sections:

==Tool Parameters== <!--T:41-->

<!--T:42-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:43-->
Some tools add a parameters section at the top of the dialog. Available options and/or modes depend on the tool.

==Sketch Edit== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
This section informs about the state of the sketch.

<!--T:46-->
The possible messages are:
* Empty sketch
* <span style="color:red;">Over-constrained: </span><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">(#, #, #)</span>
* <span style="color:red;">Malformed constraints: </span><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">(#, #, #)</span>
* <span style="color:red;">Redundant constraints: </span><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">(#, #, #)</span>
* <span style="color:blue;">Partially redundant: </span><span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">(#, #, #)</span>
* <span style="color:red;">Solver failed to converge</span>
* Under-constrained: <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">n Degrees of Freedom</span>
* <span style="color:green;">Fully constrained</span>

<!--T:30-->
If a sketch is under-constrained the number of degrees of freedom is indicated. Clicking the underlined text will select the under-constrained sketch elements. See [[Image:Sketcher_SelectElementsWithDoFs.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_SelectElementsWithDoFs|Sketcher SelectElementsWithDoFs]].

<!--T:31-->
If a sketch has redundant constraints or is over-constrained the indices of the involved constraints are indicated. Clicking the underlined text will select them. See [[Image:Sketcher_SelectRedundantConstraints.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_SelectRedundantConstraints|Sketcher SelectRedundantConstraints]] and [[Image:Sketcher_SelectConflictingConstraints.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_SelectConflictingConstraints|Sketcher SelectConflictingConstraints]].

<!--T:50-->
Malformed constraints can be fixed with [[Image:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Sketcher ValidateSketch]].

<!--T:47-->
Some messages are displayed in red for a reason: they are warnings that should not be ignored. They signal issues that must be addressed as they interfere with the solver. The messages are not mutually exclusive. If more than one applies only the first in the list is displayed.

<!--T:51-->
To change the colors used for the message see [[Fine-tuning#Constraint_label_colors|Fine-tuning]].

|-
| {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_Settings.svg|x16px]] [[Image:Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg|x16px]]}}
| This button opens a menu:
* {{MenuCommand|Auto-update}}: If checked, the whole document is recomputed after every sketch action. Not advisable for complex documents.
* {{MenuCommand|Display grid}}: Toggles the visibility of the grid. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Grid auto-spacing}}: If checked, grid spacing is automatically adapted based on the view dimensions. Stored in the {{PropertyView|Grid Auto}} property of the sketch. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Snap to grid}}: Toggles grid snap in all sketches. If checked, the cursor will snap to grid lines and grid intersections. Snapping occurs if the distance of the cursor to a grid line is 20% of the grid spacing or less. Snapping also works if the grid is invisible. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Spacing}}: Specifies the distance between two subsequent grid lines. Used as a base value if {{MenuCommand|Grid auto-spacing}} is enabled. Stored in the {{PropertyView|Grid Size}} property of the sketch. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Snap to objects}}: If checked, the cursor will snap to edges of geometry and midpoints of lines and arcs. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Snap angle}}: Specifies the angle for angular snap. Snapping will occur at multiples of this value starting from the direction of the positive X-axis of the sketch. The {{KEY|Ctrl}} key must be held down for this snap. Angular snap only works when creating certain geometry. {{Version|1.1}}
* {{MenuCommand|Rendering order}}: items in the list can be dragged to change the rendering order of all sketches. In case of coincident objects, the rendering order determines which elements appear on top, and are therefore selected first, in the [[3D_View|3D View]]. {{Version|1.1}}

<!--T:52-->
Snapping only works while creating geometry. Note that snapping is just a drawing aid, it does not produce additional constraints.

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Default solver}}
| The solver that is used for solving the geometry. '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm LevenbergMarquardt]''' and '''DogLeg''' are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_region trust region] optimization algorithms. The '''BFGS''' solver uses the  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm].
|-
| {{MenuCommand|DogLeg Gauss step}}
| This setting is only available for the solver '''DogLeg'''. It is the step type used in the DogLeg algorithm.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Maximum iterations}}
| If the solver needs more iterations to find a convergence to a solution, it will stop and output that it failed.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Sketch size multiplier}}
|  If checked, the maximum iterations will be multiplied by the number of parameters. The idea is that bigger sketches would need more iterations to converge.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Convergence}}
| The threshold for the squared error. This error is used to determine whether a solution converges or not.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Eps/Eps1/Tau}}
| These settings are only available for the solver '''LevenbergMarquardt'''. You should only change something here  if you fully understand how the LevenbergMarquardt solver works.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Tolg/Tolx/Tolf}}
| These settings are only available for the solver '''DogLeg'''. You should only change something here if you fully understand how the DogLeg solver works.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|QR Algorithm}}
| During diagnosing the rank of the matrix is calculated which enables to further analyze the constraint system to determine if there are redundant/conflicting constraints. The rank revealing decomposition used in FreeCAD is QR. There are two algorithms: '''Eigen Dense QR''' is a dense matrix QR with full pivoting, which is the legacy proven algorithm that works very well but it is rather slow as the system grows. The '''Eigen Sparse QR''' algorithm is an optimization for sparse matrices (having lots of zeros), which is usually much faster, since FreeCAD's systems do have a lot of zeros.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Pivot threshold}}
| When doing a QR, values under the pivot threshold are treated as zero.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Redundant Solver}}
| The solver that is used during diagnosing to determine whether a group is redundant or conflicting.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Red. Max Iterations}}
| The same as {{MenuCommand|Maximum iterations}}, but for the redundant solving.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Red. Sketch size multiplier}}
| The same as {{MenuCommand|Sketch size multiplier}}, but for the redundant solving.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Red. Convergence}} 
| The same as {{MenuCommand|Convergence}}, but for the redundant solving.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|R.Eps/R.Eps1/R.Tau}}
| The same as {{MenuCommand|Eps/Eps1/Tau}}, but for the redundant solving.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|R.Tolg/R.Tolx/R.Tolf}}
| The same as {{MenuCommand|Tolg/Tolx/Tolf}}, but for the redundant solving.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Console Debug mode}}
| Setting to specify the verbosity of the console output.
|-
| {{Button|Solve}}
| This button explicitly starts the solver.
|-
| {{Button|Restore Defaults}}
| This button restores the default solver settings.

==Constraints== <!--T:17-->

<!--T:34-->
This section lists the constraints in the sketch. Unchecking a constraint in the list will hide it in the sketch. Constraints can be selected in the list as well as in the sketch.

<!--T:49-->
Constraints can also be (un)hidden with [[Image:Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_SwitchVirtualSpace|Sketcher SwitchVirtualSpace]].

* {{MenuCommand|All}}: All constraints.
* {{MenuCommand|Geometric}}: Geometric constraints.
* {{MenuCommand|Datums}}: [[Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint|Driving]] dimensional constraints. Does not work properly: all dimensional constraints are filtered.
* {{MenuCommand|Named}}: Named constraints. Does not work.
* {{MenuCommand|Reference}}: [[Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint|Driven]] dimensional constraints. Does not work.
* {{MenuCommand|Selected constraints}}: Constraints selected in the sketch.
* {{MenuCommand|Associated constraints}}: Constraints associated with elements selected in the sketch.
|-
| {{Button|[[Image:Std_ToggleVisibility.svg|x16px]]}}
| This button toggles the visibility of the listed constraints in the sketch.
|-
| {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_Settings.svg|x16px]] [[Image:Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg|x16px]]}}
| This button opens a menu:
* {{MenuCommand|Auto constraints}}: If checked, some geometric constraints are applied automatically to new elements.
* {{MenuCommand|Auto remove redundants}}: If checked, new constraints that are redundant are automatically removed.
* {{MenuCommand|Show only filtered Constraints}}: If checked, only the listed constraints are shown in the sketch.
* {{MenuCommand|Extended information (in widget)}}: If checked, extended information is added in this form:
: {{Incode|[(GeoID1,PosID1),(GeoID2,PosID2),(GeoID3,PosID3)]}}
: GeoID is a zero-based index for non-external geometry. The X-axis has GeoID -1, the Y-axis has GeoID -2. GeoID -3, -4 etc. are used for external geometry.
: PosID can have the following values:
: 0 = edge, 1 = start point, 2 = end point, 3 = center point.
: For example a dimension from the origin to the center of a circle that is the 2nd non-external element in the sketch will have this extended information:
: {{Incode|[(-1,1),(1,3)]}}
* {{MenuCommand|Hide internal alignment (in widget)}}: If checked, constraints associated with internal alignments are hidden in the list. The [[Image:Sketcher_RestoreInternalAlignmentGeometry‎.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_RestoreInternalAlignmentGeometry|Show/Hide internal geometry]] tool can also hide these constraints, but will also hide the internal alignments in the sketch.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Context menu}}
| Right-clicking the background of the list, or right-clicking constraints selected in the list opens a context menu. The menu has the following options:
* {{MenuCommand|Change Value}}: Changes the value of a dimensional constraint. Only works for a single constraint. You can also double click the constraint in the list, or double click its value in the [[3D_View|3D View]].
* {{MenuCommand|Toggle Driving/Reference}}: See [[Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint|Sketcher ToggleDrivingConstraint]].
* {{MenuCommand|Deactivate}} or {{MenuCommand|Activate}}: See [[Sketcher_ToggleActiveConstraint|Sketcher ToggleActiveConstraint]].
* {{MenuCommand|Show Constraints}}: Same as checking the constraint checkbox. But, unlike the checkbox, also works for more than one constraint.
* {{MenuCommand|Hide Constraints}}: Same as unchecking the constraint checkbox. Idem.
* {{MenuCommand|Select Elements}}: See [[Sketcher_SelectElementsAssociatedWithConstraints|Sketcher SelectElementsAssociatedWithConstraints]].
* {{MenuCommand|Rename}}: Renames the constraint.
* {{MenuCommand|Center Sketch}}: Centers the 3D View around the selected constraints.
* {{MenuCommand|Delete}}: Deletes the selected constrains. The {{KEY|Del}} key can also be used.
* {{MenuCommand|Swap Constraint Names}}: Swaps the names of selected constraints. Only works if two constraints with user given names are selected.
