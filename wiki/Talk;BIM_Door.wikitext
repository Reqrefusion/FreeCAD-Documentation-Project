== My menu doesn't have 3D/BIM - Door button ==

My menu doesn't have BIM in the menu, it says Arch. But I didn't find the Door button in it. Do I have to create it? Is it a problem in the version? I use Linux Mint. Thank you! [[User:Almos|Almos]] ([[User talk:Almos|talk]]) 13:35, 10 September 2025 (UTC)
