==Description==

Tool utility to create:
* Points (mid points, center of circle, center of object(s)...), 
* Axes (from 2 points, Normal of a plane...), 
* Planes (from 3 points, from one axis and a point...)
* And many other useful features to facilitate the creation of your project. This utility is up next in the combo view with "Work Features" label.

===Cutting tools===

'''Setting of the Cutting tools:''' Select an object to cut, a cutting line and a reference Plane.
Angle is an angle between the cutting Plane and the Ref. Plane.
Thickness is the wide of the of the cutting Plane.

== External workbenches ==

FreeCAD workbenches are easy to program in [[Python|Python]], there are therefore many people developing additional workbenches outside of the FreeCAD main developers.

The [[external workbenches|external workbenches]] page has some information and tutorials on some of them, and the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons/ FreeCAD Addons] project aims at gathering them and making them easily installable from within FreeCAD.

New workbenches are in development, stay tuned!
