На этой странице собрана вся информация о решателях метода конечных элементов (МКЭ), используемых [[FEM_Workbench/ru|верстаком FEM]]. Интерфейс между решателем и FreeCAD в предварительной и последующей обработке выполнен через текстовые файлы. Теоретически это означает, что любой решатель, который может быть сконфигурирован и управляться через текстовые файлы, способен работать с FreeCAD, чтобы эта коммуникация действовала, необходимо запрограммировать соответствующий синтаксический анализатор и писатель входных и выходных файлов.

В Wikipedia  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finite_element_software_packages перечислены многие пакеты программ анализа конечных элементов]. Их сравнение можно посмотреть на [https://feacompare.com/ feacompare.com].

=== Available solvers in various Linux distributions ===

The [https://github.com/luzpaz/FreeCAD-dependencies FreeCAD-dependencies] repository tracks the dependencies of FreeCAD across many Linux distributions. The [https://github.com/luzpaz/FreeCAD-dependencies/blob/master/FC-Workbenches/FEM.md FEM.md] page looks at available open-source FEA solvers that could be used with the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]]. The page shows the version of a particular solver in the repository of a particular Linux distribution. This information is useful to know if a solver is current, or out of date and must be upgraded.

The information is also discussed in the forum: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=26326&start=10#p270325 supported and not supported Solver].

== Solvers with an interface in FreeCAD ==

These solvers are well integrated into FreeCAD, which means that it's possible to set up and run a simulation project from the graphical interface and buttons in the FEM Workbench.

=== CalculiX ===

This is the first solver that was integrated to work with the FEM Workbench. CalculiX is designed principally for static, thermo-mechanical, and modal analyses. More information about this solver is in [[FEM_CalculiX|FEM CalculiX]].

=== Elmer ===

The Elmer multiphysics solver was integrated into FreeCAD as a [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2017|Google Summer of Code 2017 project]]: [https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer main website], [http://www.elmerfem.org./ community portal], [https://github.com/ElmerCSC/elmerfem code repository], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=22576 Elmer Integration (GSoC) - Activity Log (forum topic)].

=== Mystran ===

Mystran is a structural analysis program that uses the Nastran input file format. It is released under MIT license which means that it's open-source. See [https://www.mystran.com/ main website], [https://github.com/dr-bill-c/MYSTRAN code repository] and [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=46171 Mystran-FreeCAD-forum (forum topic)].

=== Z88 ===

The Z88 solver is designed for linear static simulations with an emphasis on teaching about the finite element method. It was the second solver to be [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=15568 integrated into FreeCAD]. Afterwards, the integration was improved as a [[Google_Summer_of_Code_2017|Google Summer of Code 2017 project]].

See the information:
* [https://en.z88.de/z88os/ Main website], [https://en.z88.de/download-z88os/ download page], [https://github.com/LSCAD/Z88OS source code repository] (and precompiled binaries).

There are two versions, Z88OS is the open-source edition, while Z88Aurora is freeware, and includes a graphical interface and additional solution methods.

== Solvers implemented as external workbenches ==

These solvers aren't integrated into the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]], which means they need a separate interface to set up a simulation project. This is achieved through [[Macros|macros]] or [[External_workbenches|external workbenches]].

=== DualSPHysics ===

[https://dual.sphysics.org/ DualSPHysics] is a set of C++, CUDA, and Java libraries that use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics smoothed particle hydrodynamics] (SPH) model named [https://wiki.manchester.ac.uk/sphysics/index.php/Main_Page SPHysics] to study free-surface flow phenomena such as crashing waves.

DesignSPHysics is an external workbench built into FreeCAD that provides a graphical user interface for DualSPHysics: [https://design.sphysics.org/ main website], [https://github.com/dualsphysics/DesignSPHysics code repository], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20595 Interesting project: DesignSPHysics fluid simulator (forum topic)].

DesignSPHysics can be installed through the [[Std_AddonMgr|AddonManager]].

=== FastHenry and FasterCap ===

FastHenry and FasterCap are inductance-resistance and capacitance field solvers developed by FastFieldSolvers: [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/default.asp main website], [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/download.htm download page] (binary and source code), [https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/forum/ forum].

The [[EM Workbench|EM Workbench]] is an external workbench that was created to serve as the front end for these electromagnetic solvers. FastHenry, for 3D magneto-quasistatic impedance analysis, is fully supported, while FasterCap is accessible through some Python macros.

See: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=33372 ElectroMagnetic Workbench (main forum topic)] , [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=31920 Electromagnetic Workbench - again.. (forum topic)], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5400 FreeCAD for ElectroMagnetics (forum topic)], [https://github.com/ediloren/EM-Workbench-for-FreeCAD code repository for the workbench].

The EM Workbench can be installed through the [[Std_AddonMgr|AddonManager]].

=== fcFEM ===

fcFEM is a finite element solver for structural and mechanical studies, implemented in Python, and which can be run directly from FreeCAD without calling external binary solvers. Therefore, it can be considered FreeCAD's own internal solver.

fcFEM was designed to overcome certain limitations from other solvers, such as CalculiX, in order to perform various structural engineering studies.

Some of the problems that are intended to be overcome by this solver include
* Mixed mesh analyses (solid-shell) for dealing with composite columns or prefabricated architectural components: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=21029&p=216682&hilit=sandwich#p216682 FEM object types (forum topic)].
* Improved beam and shell elements, as CalculiX's beam elements seem to give wrong results: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=27903&hilit=beam#p226038 CalculiX 3-node Beam Element (forum topic)], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=21029&start=100 FEM object types (forum topic)], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16044 Example for 1D analysis (forum topic)].
* Arc-length control for overcoming limit points for elastic-plastic collapse analysis: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=26921&hilit=riks#p215325 FEM - Tubular Connection with Shell Elements (forum topic)].
* Zero-thickness interface elements for various applications, like post-tensioned concrete with friction: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=30286&hilit=classical&start=20#p259636 pre-stressed pre/post-tensioned concrete bridge (forum topic)].

The author considers FreeCAD a good prototyping platform to quickly set up, test, and visualize different structural problems, so having an integrated yet flexible solver is very helpful. See [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=33974 fcFEM - FEA from start to finish (main forum topic)].

fcFEM is packaged as a Python library and a macro and can be downloaded from the [https://github.com/HarryvL/fcFEM github repository]. It will eventually be available from the [[Std_AddonMgr|AddonManager]] or will be distributed as part of FreeCAD itself.

=== OpenFoam ===

[https://openfoam.org/ OpenFoam] is a powerful framework for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics computational fluid dynamics] (CFD) simulation, distributed as a series of C++ libraries.

OpenFoam is available in FreeCAD through two external workbenches:
* [https://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd Cfd], originally by Qingfeng Xia.
* [https://github.com/jaheyns/CfdOF CfdOF], a fork of Cfd focusing on ease of use.

While Cfd is intended to be feature-complete for advanced users, CfdOF focuses on users who are just starting in the world of CFD and OpenFoam.

For Cfd: [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=13699 update on FreeCAD + OpenFOAM fluid dynamic computation (forum topic)], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=22993 Progress of the general Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) workbench: CfdWorkbench (old forum topic)].

=== FEniCS ===

FEniCS is a computing framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with high-level programming interfaces in Python and C++. It can be used to establish scientific problems in finite element formulations that then can be solved numerically.

See: [https://fenicsproject.org/ main website], [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=4677 Fenics as Solver (forum topic)].

[https://github.com/qingfengxia/FenicsSolver FenicsSolver] is a simulation platform to deal with multi-body, multi-physics (coupled), multi-scale problems. It hopes to integrate the FEniCS solver into both the [[FEM Workbench|FEM Workbench]] and the Cfd [[External_workbenches|external workbench]], so the resulting system functions like a free alternative to Comsol or Moose. FenicsSolver is being developed by the same author of Cfd.

=== OOFEM ===

[http://www.oofem.org/ OOFEM] is an object-oriented FEM program by the Czech Technical University, for solving mechanical, transport and fluid mechanics problems.
