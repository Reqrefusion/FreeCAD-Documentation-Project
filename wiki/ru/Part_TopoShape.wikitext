== Введение ==

A [[Part_TopoShape|Part TopoShape]], or formally a {{incode|Part::TopoShape}}, is a class that defines a parametric '''topological shape''' in the software. Objects in the document that show something in the [[3D view|3D view]] normally have a TopoShape.

The topological shapes, as well as their methods, are defined by the [[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE Technology]] kernel (OCCT). FreeCAD uses these shapes, and builds [[App_DocumentObject|App DocumentObjects]] around them.

Another type of class is that of [[Mesh|meshes]]; this class is not very parametric because it can't be redefined easily except by specifying individual vertices and triangular surfaces.

==Применение==

The Part TopoShape is an object that is assigned to some [[App_DocumentObject|App DocumentObjects]].

In particular, the basic object that handles these types of attributes is the [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class). All objects derived from this class will have access to a Part TopoShape.

Some of the most important objects with Part TopoShape are the following: 
* Any primitive solid created with the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]].
* Any [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] and [[PartDesign_Feature|PartDesign Feature]] created with the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
* Any object derived from [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]], like most objects created with the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]].
* Any [[Sketch|sketch]], that is, [[Sketcher_SketchObject|Sketcher SketchObject]], created with the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]].
* Any object created by importing a STEP, BREP, and similar solid format files.

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD Scripting Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]], and [[scripted objects|scripted objects]].

All objects derived from {{incode|Part::Feature}} will have a [[Part TopoShape|Part TopoShape]], which is normally accessible from its {{incode|Shape}} attribute.
{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "Box")
print(obj.Shape)
}}

A TopoShape has many attributes (variables) and methods that contain information about it, and which allow doing operations with it. These variables and methods can be tested in the [[Python_console|Python console]].
{{Code|code=
print(obj.Shape.Area)
print(obj.Shape.BoundBox)
print(obj.Shape.CenterOfMass)
print(obj.Shape.ShapeType)

obj.Shape.check()
obj.Shape.copy()
obj.Shape.exportStep("my_file.step")
obj.Shape.exportStl("my_file.stl")
}}

For a full list of attributes and methods, consult the [[Source_documentation|source documentation]], and the {{Button|[[File:Std PythonHelp.svg|16px]] [[Std_PythonHelp|Std PythonHelp]]}} tool.

You can obtain a quick summary of all methods using Python's built-in {{incode|help()}} function.
{{Code|code=
help(obj.Shape)
