==Description==

The '''TechDraw ProjectShape''' tool creates projections of shapes. The projections are created in the [[3D_view|3D view]], and not on a [[TechDraw_PageDefault|TechDraw Page]].

[[File:ProjectShape1_it.png]]

== Usage ==

# Optionally rotate the [[3D_view|3D view]]. The objects will be projected onto a plane parallel to the screen i.e. along the 3D view's camera direction, which is used as the default {{PropertyData|Direction}} property. 
# Select one or more objects. For each object a separate projection will be created.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_ProjectShape.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_ProjectShape|Project shape...]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → TechDraw Views → [[Image:TechDraw_ProjectShape.svg|16px]] Project shape...}} option from the menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Project shapes}} task panel opens. See [[#Properties|Properties]].
# Set the desired options.
# The selected options should not result in an empty projection as this will cause an error. For example, for an object with only sharp edges such as a [[Part_Box|Part Box]], the {{MenuCommand|Visible sharp edges}} and/or {{MenuCommand|Hidden sharp edges}} option must be checked.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button.
# The projection is placed on the XY plane.
# Optionally change the {{PropertyData|Placement}} property and/or {{PropertyData|Direction}} property of the projection.

== Properties ==

A Projection object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Projection}}

* {{PropertyData|Source|Link}}: The shape to project.
* {{PropertyData|Direction|Vector}}: The direction of the projection. This is the normal vector of the projection plane.
* {{PropertyData|VCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, visible sharp edges are shown. Example: all edges of a [[Part_Box|Part Box]].
* {{PropertyData|Rg1 Line VCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, visible smooth edges are shown. Example: the edges between a fillet and its adjoining faces.
* {{PropertyData|Rg NLine VCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, visible sewn edges are shown. Example: the seam of a 360° cylindrical face.
* {{PropertyData|Out Line VCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, visible outline edges (that are not sharp) are shown. Example: the side view of a [[Part_Cylinder|Part Cylinder]] has two such edges.
* {{PropertyData|Iso Line VCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, visible isoparameters are shown. Does not work currently.
* {{PropertyData|HCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, hidden sharp edges are shown.
* {{PropertyData|Rg1 Line HCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, hidden smooth edges are shown
* {{PropertyData|Rg NLine HCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, hidden sewn edges are shown.
* {{PropertyData|Out Line HCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, hidden outline edges are shown.
* {{PropertyData|Iso Line HCompound|Bool}}: If {{TRUE}}, hidden isoparameters are shown. Does not work currently.
