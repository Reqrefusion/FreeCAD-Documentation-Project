== Описание == 

The [[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|24px]] '''PartDesign Draft''' tool creates angular draft on the selected faces of an object. It adds a '''Draft''' object to the document with its corresponding representation in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].

<span id="Usage"></span>
== Применение ==

=== Add a draft ===

# Optionally [[PartDesign_Body#Active_status|activate]] the Body to apply the Draft to.
# Select one or more faces of the Body.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Draft|Draft]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part Design → Apply a dress-up feature → [[Image:PartDesign_Draft.svg|16px]] Draft}} option from the menu.
# If there is no active Body, and there are two or more Bodies in the document, the {{MenuCommand|Active Body Required}} dialog will open and prompt you to activate one. If there is a single Body it will be activated automatically.
# The {{MenuCommand|Draft parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.


:''Remember'':
:* Since there must be at least one face for the feature, the last remaining face in the list cannot be removed.

=== Edit a draft ===

# Do one of the following:
#* Double-click the Draft object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
#* Right-click the Draft object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] and select {{MenuCommand|Edit Draft}} from the context menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Draft parameters}} [[Task_panel|task panel]] opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|OK}} button to finish.

== Опции ==

* {{MenuCommand|Add face}}: Add faces to the selection by pressing the {{Button|Add face}} button and selecting more faces. 
* {{MenuCommand|Remove face}}: Choose a way to remove faces from the selection:
** Select one or more faces in the list and press the {{KEY|Del}} key or right-click the list and select {{MenuCommand|Remove}} from the context menu.
** Press the {{Button|Remove face}} button. All previously selected faces are highlighted in purple. Select each face to be removed.
* {{MenuCommand|Draft angle}}: Set the Draft angle either by entering a value or by clicking the up/down arrows.
* {{MenuCommand|Neutral plane}}: Set the the neutral plane by pressing the {{Button|Neutral plane}} button and selecting the plane that must not change dimensionally.
* {{MenuCommand|Pull direction}}: Set the the pull direction by pressing the {{Button|Pull direction}} button, then select an edge. Pull Direction is only effective if the Neutral Plane has been set. Results can be unpredictable.
* {{MenuCommand|Reverse pull direction}}: Invert the pull direction by checking the {{MenuCommand|Reverse pull direction}} checkbox. This will toggle the draft between positive and negative angles.

<span id="Notes"></span>
== Примечания ==

* The Draft tool will only work on faces that are not tangentially connected to other faces. A common mistake is to attempt to apply draft to a face that already has a fillet applied to it. To solve this, remove the fillet, apply the draft as needed, then re-apply the fillet.

A PartDesign Draft object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

===Data===

{{Properties_Title|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Angle|Angle}}: Cannot be negative. Default: {{value|1.5 °}}.
* {{PropertyData|Reversed|Bool}}: Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Base|LinkSub}}: Sub-link to the parent feature's list of selected edges and faces.
* {{PropertyData|Support Transform|Bool}}: Include the base additive/subtractive shape when used in pattern features. If disabled, only the dressed part of the shape is used for patterning. Default: {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyData|Add Sub Shape|PartShape|hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Base Feature|Link|hidden}}: Link to the parent feature.
* {{PropertyData|_ Body|LinkHidden|hidden}}: Link to the parent body.

{{Properties_Title|Draft}}

* {{PropertyData|Neutral Plane|LinkSub}}: Sub-link to the parent feature's list containing the neutral plane.
* {{PropertyData|Pull Direction|LinkSub}}

{{Properties_Title|Part Design}}

* {{PropertyData|Refine|Bool}}: Refine shape (clean up redundant edges) after adding/subtracting. The default value is determined by the {{MenuCommand|Automatically refine model after sketch-based operation}} preference. See [[PartDesign_Preferences#General|PartDesign Preferences]].
