== Введение ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This tutorial shows how to produce a rendered image in [https://www.blender.org/ Blender], beginning from a part or assembly created with FreeCAD. It assumes that the user already created the part in FreeCAD, or has imported it into it. Then this part is exported to Blender for rendering.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
It produces a rendering with Blender 2.80 with both the EEVEE and Cycles renderers. It shows various [[Python|Python]] commands that can be used to perform actions quicker both in FreeCAD and Blender.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
A similar description of this process is described in a series of videos, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7e6-Wfv2b0 Render Solidworks and FreeCAD Models in Blender], by Joko Engineering.
</div>

== FreeCAD ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
1. Create an assembly using bodies from the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] or [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]], or any other workbench that produces solid objects, for example, the [[Arch_Workbench|Arch Workbench]]. Assign colors or materials to the individual bodies that make the assembly, approximately matching the color that you want in your render.

{{Caption|align=center|Assembly of three bodies created in FreeCAD, and with colors or materials assigned.}}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
2. If your model is very detailed, make sure the {{PropertyView|Deviation}} of the body is set to a low value, between {{incode|0.1}} and {{incode|0.01}}, or even smaller. The lower this value is, the more detailed the exported mesh will be, and thus the better the quality of the render will be.

3. Select the {{incode|Part}}, then {{MenuCommand|File → Export}}, or press {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|E}}, and export it as {{incode|Wavefront OBJ}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Alternatively, the export can be done from the [[Python|Python]] console. Define a list of objects to be exported and use the exporting function with a file name.
</div>

{{Code|code=
import importOBJ
objs = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.getObjectsByLabel("Part")[0]

importOBJ.export(objs, "/home/user/assembly.obj")
}}

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{Emphasis|Note:}} when exporting to OBJ, two files are created; the first one contains the mesh information itself, {{incode|assembly.obj}}; the second one contains the definition of the materials, which in most cases is just the color, {{incode|assembly.mtl}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{Emphasis|Note 2:}} if the resulting OBJ file appears to be empty, you may have to export the individual bodies. In this case, select each of the bodies under the part, and repeat the export.

4. Open Blender. Change the {{incode|Timeline}} panel into a {{incode|Python Console}} ({{KEY|Shift}}+{{KEY|F4}}). This will help you to input commands and see the results. You may divide this panel, to keep the console on one side, and make the other division an {{incode|Info}} panel; this will allow you to see the code of the actions as you click on the interface.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Make sure you are using the EEVEE renderer. In the {{incode|Properties}} panel go to {{incode|Render}}, and for {{incode|Render Engine}} select {{incode|Eevee}}.
</div>

{{Code|code=
bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'BLENDER_EEVEE'
}}

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
5. Import the model file from the menu, {{MenuCommand|File → Import → Wavefront (.obj)}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Alternatively, importing can be done from the {{incode|Python Console}}.

{{Code|code=
obj_file = "/home/user/assembly.obj"
bpy.ops.import_scene.obj(filepath=obj_file)

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
6. Change the scale.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If the bodies appear to be very large you may have to change the units so the objects appear at the right scale.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In the {{incode|Properties}} panel go to {{incode|Scene}}, {{incode|Units}}, and select the appropriate {{incode|Unit System}}, {{incode|Unit Scale}}, and {{incode|Length}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
For small parts, you may wish to keep the length to {{incode|Millimeters}}, and the scale to {{incode|0.001}}. For bigger parts, for example, the model of a building, you may have to set these values to {{incode|Meters}} and {{incode|0.001}}. Try other values of scale as required.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This can be set also from the {{incode|Python console}}.
</div>

{{Code|code=

}}

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{Emphasis|Note:}} changing the scale and units of the scene is only necessary if you wish to work with objects at their true dimensions. If you just want to render your scene quickly, you may omit any adjustment.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
6.1. If you zoom out, and the view cuts the imported parts, you may have to adjust the view clip values.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hit {{KEY|N}} to show the auxiliary panel; go to the {{incode|View}} section and set the {{incode|End}} to a large value, for example, {{incode|1E6 mm}} or {{incode|1000 m}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
6.2. If you wish, also adjust the size of the grid; go to {{incode|Overlays}}, then {{incode|Guides}}, and set the {{incode|Scale}} of the grid to {{incode|0.001}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
7. Fix the rotation of the objects.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
When imported, objects may appear rotated around one of the axes, for example, 90 degrees around the X axis.
Hit {{KEY|N}} to show the auxiliary panel; select an object, go to the {{incode|Transform}} section and set the {{incode|Rotation}} to {{incode|0°}} in each field. Do this for every object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This can be automated by a small script that just sets the rotation of each imported body to zero, with the exception of the objects inside the {{incode|fixed_objs}} tuple. This can be useful if you are importing objects into an existing scene where other objects are already in their right positions.
</div>

{{Code|code=
fixed_objs = ('Camera', 'Cube', 'Light')

for obj in bpy.data.objects:
    if any(s for s in fixed_objs if s in obj.name):
        print('%s %s  [[No change]]' % (obj.name, obj.rotation_euler))

8.1. If you don't see anything in the camera view, you may need to adjust the clipping. Selecting the camera in the {{incode|Outliner}}, go to the {{incode|Properties}} panel, then {{incode|Object Data}}, then {{incode|Lens}}, then set the {{incode|Clip End}} to a large value, for example, {{incode|1E3 mm}} or {{incode|1000 m}}.

For metallic parts, turn the {{incode|Metallic}} property all the way to {{incode|1.000}}. Adjust the value of {{incode|Roughness}} to be between {{incode|0.2}} and {{incode|0.7}}. The closer to {{incode|0.000}} the {{incode|Roughness}} is, the more reflective (mirror-like) it will appear.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
For non metals, like plastics, wood and textiles, set the {{incode|Metallic}} slider all the way to {{incode|0.000}}, and adjust the value of {{incode|Roughness}} to between {{incode|0.4}} and {{incode|1.0}}.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In general, metals are naturally smooth and therefore their roughness value is small, making them very reflective (shiny). Other materials are microscopically rough, and therefore do not reflect as much light, making them opaque.

14. Test different combinations of materials until they look acceptable. Press {{KEY|Z}} and then {{KEY|8}} (numerical pad) to enter {{incode|Rendered}} mode; in this mode, the EEVEE renderer shows in real time in the 3D viewport how the final image will look like. Use {{KEY|Z}} to open the pie menu and switch back to {{incode|Solid}} mode ({{KEY|Z}} {{KEY|6}}), or go to {{incode|LookDev}} mode ({{KEY|Z}} {{KEY|2}}), a mode which adds different types of lighting to the scene to test the appearance of the materials.

== Importing plugin ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Creating the intermediate Wavefront mesh (.obj) and then importing it into Blender will work in most situations. However, there is also the option of importing the FreeCAD file (.FCStd) directly into Blender by means of a plugin.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This is a Blender plugin; for it to work, Blender needs to be able to import FreeCAD as a module from the {{incode|Python Console}}.
</div>
{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD
}}

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
This is only possible if both Blender and FreeCAD are compiled against the same {{incode|pythonX.Y}} (major and minor) version. For example, if Blender is compiled against Python 3.7, FreeCAD must be compiled against a Python 3.7 version as well. If FreeCAD is compiled against another version, for example, Python 2.7.15 or Python 3.6.7, the plugin will not work. The micro version number (third number) does not matter, that is, the plugin should work if one software is compiled against Python 3.7.5 and the other against Python 3.7.8.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In addition, the FreeCAD precompiled Python module, {{incode|FreeCAD.so}} on Linux and {{incode|FreeCAD.pyd}} on Windows, should be in the Python path used by Blender to import modules. This path can be set up in different ways, depending on the operating system and Python distribution.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In Blender you can see all paths searched by inspecting the {{incode|sys.path}} variable. The FreeCAD module should be found in any of those directories.
</div>
{{Code|code=

== Final notes ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
EEVEE is not a physically accurate renderer, however its main strength is that it is a real time engine so it is able to produce quick renderings directly in the 3D viewport. In many cases these images have enough quality for final production, which means it is possible to obtain a good result in a very short time. In cases where complex light interactions are desired (reflections, refractions, volumetric light, and caustics) EEVEE is more limited, and requires some options and tricks to work around some of these limitations.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
On the other hand, Cycles is a true raytracing renderer which means it is more accurate at calculating light paths in a scene. Cycles is the recommended renderer when the best quality is desired (photorealistic results), at the cost of more rendering time.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Both renderers can be used to leverage the advantages of each. In many cases the scene can be quickly prepared and tested with EEVEE to obtain preliminary renderings; then the same scene can be used with minor changes with Cycles in order to produce a higher quality, final rendering. In particular, when a scene that was setup with EEVEE will be used with Cycles, the lights may need to be adjusted in value and position as both renderers treat light in different ways.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Obtaining good results is highly dependent on the rendering options, the materials, and the lighting. The {{incode|Principled BSDF}} material shader is a generic solution that works well for many cases, however, to produce truly photorealistic results, the use of texture maps and normal maps, along with careful lighting of the scene is still very important.
</div>
