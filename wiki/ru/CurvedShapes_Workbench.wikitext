== Введение ==

Curved Shapes is a FreeCAD [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] that creates 3D shapes from 2D curves. 

==Installation==

Recommended installation is through the FreeCAD [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px|link=Std_AddonMgr]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]] via the {{MenuCommand|Tools → Addon Manager}}

==Tools==

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_CurvedArray.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_CurvedArray]] [[CurvedShapes_CurvedArray|Curved Array]]: Creates an array and resizes the items in the bounds of one or more hull curves.

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_CurvedPathArray.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_CurvedPathArray]] [[CurvedShapes_CurvedPathArray|Curved Path Array]]

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_CurvedSegment.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_CurvedSegment]] [[CurvedShapes_CurvedSegment|Curved Segment]]: Interpolates between two 2D curves. The interpolated curves can be resized in the bounds of some hullcurves.

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_CurvedPathSegment.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_CurvedPathSegment]] [[CurvedShapes_CurvedPathSegment|Curved Path Segment]]

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_InterpolatedMiddle.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_InterpolatedMiddle]] [[CurvedShapes_InterpolatedMiddle|Interpolated Middle]]: Interpolates a 2D shape into the middle between two 2D curves. The base shapes can be connected to a shape with a sharp corner.

* [[Image:CurvedShapes_SurfaceCut.svg|24px|link=CurvedShapes_SurfaceCut]] [[CurvedShapes_SurfaceCut|Surface Cut]]: Cuts a surface to get the outline curve or a face.
