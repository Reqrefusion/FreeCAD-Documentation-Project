For example, if we have a Sketch consisting of only one point, and the point has no [[#Constraint|Constraints]] applied to it, the point has two [[#DOF|DOF]] because it is free to move both vertically and horizontally. Similarly, a Sketch consisting of only a single unconstrained circle has three [[#DOF|DOF]] because the circle can move vertically and horizontally and, additionally, the radius is not defined.

{{term|Self Intersection}}
{{defn|defn=A condition where a curve crosses over itself (ex.'8','&'). This confuses geometric kernel algorithms and generally produces an error condition.}}
{{term|Shape}}
{{defn|defn=Generic term used in FreeCAD to describe most elements (except for [[#Mesh|meshes]]).}}
{{term|Shell}}
{{defn|defn=Shape made of two or more contiguous [[#Face|faces]]. A [[#Manifold|manifold]] (enclosed) shell can be converted into a [[#Solid|solid]].}}
{{term|Sketch}}

{{term|Sketcher Solver}}
{{defn|defn=The internal FreeCAD mechanism that calculates inter-dependencies and effects of adding, deleting, and modifying geometry and associated constraints in each Sketch. Sketcher Solver also calculates the arrangement of all geometry in each Sketch so it can be displayed correctly.}}
{{term|Smooth Line}}
{{defn|defn=In a Drawing, a line indicating a change between tangent surfaces, as in the transition from a flat surface to a fillet. Also "tangent edge". See [[Drawing_View#Modify_an_existing_view|Drawing View]]}}
{{term|Solid}}
{{defn|defn=Part of 3D space bounded by [[#Shell|Shells]]. A solid has a volume and other properties related to objects with a mass.}}
{{term|Solver}}
{{defn|defn=See [[#Sketcher_Solver|Sketcher Solver]].}}
{{term|Stable}}
{{defn|defn=A nickname for the last general release version of the FreeCAD software. This is typically the version available from sources other than the FreeCAD project. Compare with [[#Unstable|Unstable]].}}
{{term|STL}}
{{defn|defn=''STereoLithography'', also known as ''Standard Tessellation Language.'' A [[#Mesh|mesh]] file format defining only the surface of a 3D object. File extensions is *.stl}}
{{term|STEP}}
{{defn|defn=An ISO standard (ISO 10303) for the exchange of 3D data and product manufacturing information. It replaces [[#IGES|IGES]]. File extensions are *.step, *.stp.}}
{{term|SVG}}
{{defn|defn=[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics Scalable Vector Graphics]. A vector graphics file format.}}
{{term|Sweep}}
{{defn|defn=A 3D shape generated from at least one 2D cross-section that traces along a trajectory (path). Commonly used to define the tool as well as the created shape. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling#Sweeping Solid modeling]}}

{{term|Task panel}}
{{defn|defn=A [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_(computer_software) control panel] in FreeCAD that displays content specific to the task at hand. It can show available tools in the active [[#Workbench|workbench]] or prompt for values and options while a [[#Command|command]] is active.}}
{{term|Tasks tab}}
{{defn|defn=See [[#Task_panel|Task panel]].}}
{{term|Tessellation}}
{{defn|defn=A tessellation of a surface is the tiling of the surface using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In FreeCAD it is needed to display the geometric shapes in the 3D-view. The tessellation relative to the dimensions of a shape can be set in the preferences to get a smoother view of round surfaces at the cost of computation time. See [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]].}}
{{term|Thickness}}
{{defn|no=1|defn=A measure of how thick a shape is.}}
{{defn|no=2|defn=A [[Part_Workbench|Part]] [[#Workbench|workbench]] tool to hollow out a solid and leave a defined uniform thickness.}}
{{term|Toggle}}
{{defn|defn=A setting that can be changed between two options, for example between True or False or between Off and On.}}
{{term|Topological Naming}}
{{defn|defn=A scheme whereby an edge or face, once created, is assigned a permanent name. Internally, FreeCAD identifies edges and faces on a solid by numbering them such as: Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2, etc. The problem is that these IDs are somewhat randomly applied, and they will change after something is done to the model that changes the amount of edges and faces. For example, if the model is revised an item linked to a Face2 could later erroneously become linked to a different face (which was renamed to become the new Face2), causing the user unwanted results.  As of the FreeCAD 0.20 release Topological Naming has not yet been implemented, and so if an object is modified such that the number of edges or faces changes, the names of the edges or faces of that object might change too.}}
{{term|Torus}}
{{defn|defn=A primitive shape.}}
{{term|Tracker}}
{{defn|defn=Short for bug tracker, the online software application used to keep track of reported bugs or feature requests. See also [[#Mantis|Mantis]].}}
{{term|Tree view|content=[[Tree_view|Tree view]]}}
{{defn|defn=The Tree view is a component of the FreeCAD [[Interface|interface]]. It can be shown as a separate [[#GUI|GUI]] element or as part of the [[Combo_View|Combo View]]. It contains a representation of the document's structure.}}

{{defn|defn=A nickname for a very recent version of the FreeCAD software. This version will contain many changes recently implemented by the developers. It does not typically fail or produce wrong results, but it has not completed testing.}}

{{term|Vector}}
{{defn|defn=A magnitude with a direction. Often represented graphically as an arrow in 2 or 3 dimensions. For example, "fifty paces north", "9.8 m/s^2 down", and "(3,5,6) units in the x, y, z, direction, respectively" are all vectors. In FreeCAD, they are most often denoted as ordered pairs (x, y) or ordered triples (x, y, z).}}
{{term|Vertex}}
{{defn|defn=A lone [[#Point|point]] in space, or the corner of a [[#shape|shape]] where [[#Edge|edges]] meet. The open Cascade Technology defines it, as a zero dimensional [[#shape|shape]] corresponding to a point in geometry. See [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html#OCCT_TUTORIAL_SUB2_3 OCCT Profile: Defining the topology]}}

{{defn|defn=Plural of [[#Vertex|Vertex]]}}
{{term|Viewprovider}}
{{defn|defn=General interface for all visual stuff in FreeCAD. A ViewProvider generates and handles all around visualizing and presenting objects from the FreeCAD [[#App|App layer]] to the user. This class and its descendents have to be implemented for any object type in order to show them in the [[#3D_view|3D view]] and [[#Tree_view|Tree view]].}}
