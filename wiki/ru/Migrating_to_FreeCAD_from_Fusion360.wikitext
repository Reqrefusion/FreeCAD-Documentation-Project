== Background ==

This page is intended for users who are interested in migrating to FreeCAD from the Fusion 360 world.

== What do I do? ==

# The first thing that you want to do is to get your files out of proprietary formats and storage. Start by exporting your models from the cloud to your local machine.
#* A popular method is using this [https://github.com/Jnesselr/fusion-360-total-exporter Fusion360 total exporter] script.
# We recommend exporting to STEP format.

== Glossary ==
{{VeryImportantMessage|Please also reference the ongoing work in progress [[CAD_Rosetta_Stone|CAD Rosetta Stone]] project to learn the analogous names that popular proprietary CADs use}}

Reference the [[Glossary|Glossary]] page in general but here is a short list of specific terms that F360 folks may find spefically helpful:


* Tangent constraint - FreeCAD's form of '''Collinear Constraint'''. See [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainTangent.svg|24px|link=Sketcher_ConstrainTangent]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainTangent#Between_two_lines_.28collinear.29|Sketcher ConstrainTangent]].
* Pad - The '''extrude''' function in FreeCAD. Read the [[Image:PartDesign_Pad.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Pad]] [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]] documentation to learn more.
* Toponaming - Short for [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological naming problem]]. Covered very well in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p2vqEEmWq4 Brodie Fairhall's youtube clip]].

== Часто задаваемые вопросы ==

# What formats do you support in FreeCAD?
#* The native file format in FreeCAD is BREP, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation boundary representation], provided by the internal [[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE (OCCT)]] geometry kernel.
#* FreeCAD supports all formats that OCCT supports, so STEP and IGES at least.
# What formats should I use to migrate to FreeCAD?
#* STEP is the best format because it is a solid [[Shape|Shape]] format, as opposed to a [[Mesh|Mesh]] (STL, OBJ, DAE). Example, [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=50308 Importing Step with Colors].
#* Importing an STL is possible, but this mesh format will be difficult to modify further. We recommend converting imported meshes to solid Shapes using {{Button|[[File:Part_ShapeFromMesh.svg|16px]] [[Part_ShapeFromMesh|Part ShapeFromMesh]]}}. Remodelling the object in FreeCAD, while using the mesh as reference, is the best advice.
