The [[Image:Reinforcement_SlabRebars.svg|24px]] [[Reinforcement_SlabRebars|Reinforcement SlabRebars]] tool allows the user to create reinforcing bars inside a Slab [[Arch_Structure|Arch Structure]] object.

This tool is part of the [[Image:Reinforcement_Workbench.svg|24px]] [[Reinforcement_Workbench|Reinforcement Workbench]], an [[External_workbenches|external workbench]] that can be installed with the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon Manager]].

In this example we will create Slab Reinforcement having L-Shape Rebars for both direction as shown in below figure.

==Usage==

1. Select any face of a previously created Slab {{Button|[[Image:Arch_Structure.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Structure|Arch Structure]]}} object. as shown in below image. 
 
: [[File:Selected_face_for_Slab_Arch_Structure.png|400px]]

2. Then select {{Button|[[Image:Reinforcement_SlabRebars.svg|16px]] [[Reinforcement_SlabRebars|Slab Reinforcement]]}} from the rebar tools.

3. A dialog box will pop-out on screen as shown below.

4. Select the desired type of cover of reinforcement mesh (Top or Bottom) In example Bottom is selected.

5. Select the LShapeRebar rebar type and other input data for rebars in parallel direction of selected face as show in below image.

The Slab Reinforcement tool can be used from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

=== Create Slab Reinforcement of L-Shape Rebars===

To create Slab reinforcement L-Shape Rebars as shown in above figures you can use makeSlabReinforcement function as follows:

{{Code|code=
 from SlabReinforcement.SlabReinforcement import makeSlabReinforcement
SlabReinforcementGroup = makeSlabReinforcement(
    parallel_rebar_type="LShapeRebar",
    parallel_front_cover=20,
    parallel_rear_cover=20,
    parallel_left_cover=10,
    parallel_right_cover=10,
    parallel_top_cover=30,
    parallel_bottom_cover=20,
    parallel_rounding=2,
    parallel_diameter=8,
    parallel_amount_spacing_check=True,
    parallel_amount_spacing_value=10,
    parallel_l_shape_hook_orintation= "Alternate",
    cross_rebar_type="LShapeRebar",
    cross_front_cover=20,
    cross_rear_cover=20,
    cross_left_cover=10,
    cross_right_cover=10,
    cross_top_cover=20,
    cross_bottom_cover=20,
    cross_rounding=2,
    cross_diameter=8,
    cross_amount_spacing_check=True,
    cross_amount_spacing_value=10,
    cross_l_shape_hook_orintation= "Alternate",
    mesh_cover_along = "Bottom",
    structure=App.getDocument("slab").getObject("Beam"),
    facename='Face4',
)
}}

* Creates a {{incode|SlabReinforcementGroup}} object for slab reinforcement having L-Shape rebars for the given {{incode|structure}}, which is a Slab [[Arch_Structure|Arch Structure]], and {{incode|facename}}, which is a face of that structure.
** If no {{incode|structure}} nor {{incode|facename}} are given, it will take the user selected face as input.
