=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:FreeCAD-Ribbon_Preferences_Miscellaneous.png|center|thumb]]

On this tab, you will find settings that are not categorized.
You can set: 
- The preferred view panel:
  - Individual views panel
  - View panel (based on the classic FreeCAD views toolbar
  - Views panel (FreeCAD Ribbon specific design, created as a new panel) 
- The use of a standard "Tools" panel. (FreeCAD Ribbon specific design, created as a new panel)   
- You can enable overlay functions. Standard the Ribbon Overlay function is used.  
   - You can enable the original overlay function of FreeCAD.   

However, the original overlay function has compatibility issues. Enable this on your own risk.  
This is also the reason that the pinbutton is removed when these functions are enabled.  

''In case there is an issue, you can restore the default overlay function by adding a file named "OVERLAY_DISABLED" (No extension) in the folder of the add-on.''

=== Ribbon commands ===
[[File:FreeCAD-Ribbon_Preferences_Commands.png|center|thumb]]

The application menu, ribbon layout menu, ribbon preferences and the pin button are added as commands to FreeCAD.

 - Ribbon_Menu          -> Shows the application menu (default: Alt+A)
 - Ribbon_Layout        -> Opens the Ribbon layout dialog (default: Alt+L)
 - Ribbon_Preferences   -> Opens the Ribbon preferences dialog (default: Alt+P)

''Notes:''
