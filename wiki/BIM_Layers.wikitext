==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:4-->
The '''Layers Manager''' allows you to manage [[Draft_Layer|layers]]. Layers are a special kind of group that controls the visual properties of objects placed inside of it. By changing the properties of the layer, such as line width, line color, shape color and transparency, the changes are propagated to its child objects. Layers don't interfere with any other FreeCAD structure such as [[Std_Group|groups]] or [[Arch_BuildingPart|Building parts]], so any object can be at the same time part of a layer and part of a group.

<!--T:5-->
Layers are imported and exported from/to [[Arch_IFC|IFC]] and [[Draft_DXF|DXF/DWG]].

<!--T:6-->
The layers manager allow you to manage your layers, add or remove layers, or change their visual properties. To add objects to a layer, simply drag them into the layer in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]]. To remove them, drag them from the layer and drop them into the document root.

==NativeIFC== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
This tool is the exact same as the [[Draft LayerManager]] tool, and creates the same layer object. There is only one difference: It has support for [[NativeIFC]] objects:

<!--T:12-->
* An IFC icon will indicate if a layer is part of an IFC project or not
* An '''Assign IFC''' button allows to move a layer to an IFC project and with that turn it into an IFC layer

Implementation of [[NativeIFC]] is a work in progress. Users can read [https://yorik.uncreated.net/?blog%2Ffreecad Yorik's blog] for updates from a lead developer of NativeIFC functionality in FreeCAD.

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:BIM_Layers.svg|16px]] [[BIM Layers]]}} button from the [[BIM_Workbench/en#Manage|Manage Toolbar]].
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Manage → [[Image:BIM_Layers.svg|16px]] manage Layers}} option from the menu.
# Set options and press {{Button|OK}}.

Layers are an organizational tool with options to control several properties of your objects:
* Graphical appearance
* Layer properties for export to vector formats like [[DXF]] & [[FreeCAD_and_DWG_Import|DWG]]
* [[NativeIFC]] properties

Creating the first layer activates BIM layers in a new file.

Refer to the documentation for [[Draft_Layer|Draft Layers]] for more information on settings.

==Note==

Use the [[BIM Layers|BIM Layers Manager]] to create new [[BIM Layers]]. To create [[Draft Layer|Draft Layers]] select the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_NewLayer.svg|16px]][[Draft Layer|Add New Layer]]}} button from the {{Button|[[File:Draft_tray_button_layer.png]] [[Draft_AutoGroup]]}} menu on the [[Draft_Tray]]

[[Draft Layer|Draft Layers]] have slightly different settings from [[BIM Layers]]. Do not mix them unless you understand the [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=102246 differences].
