==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:4-->
The '''Layers Manager''' allows you to manage [[Draft_Layer|layers]]. Layers are a special kind of group that controls the visual properties of objects placed inside of it. By changing the properties of the layer, such as line width, line color, shape color and transparency, the changes are propagated to its child objects. Layers don't interfere with any other FreeCAD structure such as [[Std_Group|groups]] or [[Arch_BuildingPart|Building parts]], so any object can be at the same time part of a layer and part of a group.

<!--T:5-->
Layers are imported and exported from/to [[Arch_IFC|IFC]] and [[Draft_DXF|DXF/DWG]].

<!--T:6-->
The layers manager allow you to manage your layers, add or remove layers, or change their visual properties. To add objects to a layer, simply drag them into the layer in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]]. To remove them, drag them from the layer and drop them into the document root.

==NativeIFC== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
This tool is the exact same as the [[Draft LayerManager]] tool, and creates the same layer object. There is only one difference: It has support for [[NativeIFC]] objects:

<!--T:12-->
* An IFC icon will indicate if a layer is part of an IFC project or not
* An '''Assign IFC''' button allows to move a layer to an IFC project and with that turn it into an IFC layer

Implementation of [[NativeIFC]] is a work in progress. Users can read [https://yorik.uncreated.net/?blog%2Ffreecad Yorik's blog] for updates from a lead developer of NativeIFC functionality in FreeCAD.

==Usage==
Layers are an organizational tool. The layers implementation the BIM workbench offers options to control several properties of your objects:
* Graphical appearance
* Layer properties for export to vector formats like [[DXF]] & [FreeCAD_and_DWG_Import|DWG]]
* [[NativeIFC]] properties

BIM layers are not activated by default in a new file. Use the [[File:Draft_tray_button_layer.png|px16]]'''[[Draft_AutoGroup|Autogroup]]''' button from the '''[[Draft_Tray]]''' to enable layers. Use the [[File:Draft_LayerManager.svg|16px]]'''[[Draft_LayerManager|Layer Manager]]''' button from the '''Manage Toolbar''' to edit layer properties.

Because usage of '''[[BIM Layers]]''' is almost identical to '''[[Draft_Layer|Draft Layers]]''', that documentation is useful for '''[[BIM_Workbench]]''' users, and it is not duplicated here.
