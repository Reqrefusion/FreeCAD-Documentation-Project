I am having an impossible hard time creating a simple square and 'sealing it' with Constraints. I use dot to dot to create 4 lines, a square.

Or even using the Square icon and making a box. When I apply constraints and click the corners multiple error messages come up ,every time i try it. 

When I click and click on a point to connect dots its very difficult because red lines are active and cover the white dot end. I cant see where to drop the dot to connect the line.

What am i doing wrong ?

Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/71.234.60.38|71.234.60.38]] 11:56, 31 January 2026 (UTC)
