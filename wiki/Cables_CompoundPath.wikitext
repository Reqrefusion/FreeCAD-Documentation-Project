==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The [[File:Cables_CompoundPath.svg|24px]] [[Cables_CompoundPath|CompoundPath]] command is designed to create a wire object based on a group of other wire objects. Its topological shape is a compound of wire shapes or a single wire shape.

<!--T:5-->
It is possible to use '''CompoundPath''' as a base for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or [[Cables_CableConduit|CableConduit]]. Proper combination of [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] and [[Cables_CompoundPath|CompoundPath]] can be used to simplify process of creation complex cable bundles or cables inside cable conduits avoiding unnecessary redundant base wires. Single '''WireFlex''' object can be a part of a few different '''CompoundPath''' objects influencing their shapes.

<!--T:6-->
The below example ilustrates the main purpose and possibilities of '''CompoundPath''' object. The source example file can be downloaded from here: [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/examples/Harness%20examples/compoundPath_Test2.FCStd compoundPath_Test2.FCStd].

<!--T:8-->
The '''CompoundPath''' cannot be directly edited like [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]]. Its shape is a result of algorithms behind the '''Path Type''' property values: {{Value|Complex}}, {{Value|Wire}} or {{Value|Simple}} and other additional properties processing its base wires declared under '''Links''' property.

<!--T:9-->
===Path Type: Complex===
The '''Path Type''':{{Value|Complex}} algorithm creates a single wire shape based on all objects listed in '''Links''' property and partially on their '''Points''' property. Therefore, the use of this algorithm is possible only if all base objects listed in '''Links''' have '''Points''' property. Otherwise it will fail. Additionally the algorithm uses other properties "guessing" user intentions to create the desired shape.

<!--T:10-->
Here are some rules used by the algorithm:
* Gaps between base objects are allowed. They will be connected automatically with lines and arcs or Bézier curve. A smaller distance between ends of base objects is chosen to create the connection.
* Direction of single base object is not important. The base objects will be connected in the order in the '''Links''' property.
* If there is no gap between base objects the connection will be corrected with arc fillets.
* If connection offset properties are used the boundary edges of base objects are shifted to reach the offset point.
* If two consecutive line edges form a single line they are replaced by a single edge.
* Tangency is preserved across all connections if possible (e.g. if '''MinimumFilletRadius''' allows it).

<!--T:11-->
===Path Type: Wire===
The '''Path Type''':{{Value|Wire}} algorithm creates a single wire shape from '''Points''' property of all objects listed in '''Links''' property. Therefore, the use of this algorithm is possible only if all base objects listed in '''Links''' have '''Points''' property. Otherwise it will fail. It produces a wire shape based on a given points which is similar to what the command [[File:Draft_Wire.png|24px]] [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] would do.

<!--T:12-->
The rules used by the algorithm are similar to those used by the '''Path Type''':{{Value|Complex}} with the exception of a Bézier curve usage. The only allowed edge shapes in this mode are lines and arcs. If base object contains other shapes (e.g. BSpline), they will be replaced by the above two.

<!--T:13-->
===Path Type: Simple===
The '''Path Type''':{{Value|Simple}} algorithm creates a compound of wire shapes listed in '''Links''' property. It produces exactly the same result like the command [[File:Part_Compound.svg|24px]] [[Part_Compound|Part Compound]] would do.

<!--T:14-->
Here any wire like objects (see [[#Notes|Note 1]]) can be used as a base for '''CompoundPath''' shape not guaranteeing the success of producing the right wire to be useful as a base for a [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or [[Cables_CableConduit|CableConduit]]. To successfully create such a wire (for [[Cables_CableConduit|CableConduit]]) the base shapes have to touch with their end vertices and additionally (to be useful as a base for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]]) they have to be properly ordered, i.e. the first vertex of the first shape must be the beginning of '''CompoundPath''' and the last vertex of the last shape must be the end of '''CompoundPath'''.

<!--T:15-->
No additional automatic actions are done with {{Value|Simple}} algorithm. If e.g. tangent connections between base shapes are needed, they have to be done manually.

<!--T:16-->
The {{Value|Simple}} algorithm can be used if results produced by {{Value|Complex}} or {{Value|Wire}} algorithms are not satisfactory. Keeping in mind the above rules, the series of connected [[Sketcher_Workbench|sketches]] freely aligned in a 3D space can be used for example as a base shapes for a '''CompoundPath'''.

==Usage== <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
# Select at least two existing wire objects (see [[#Notes|Note 1]]) in the [[3D_view|3D view]] or [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# Create '''CompoundPath''' by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Cables_CompoundPath.svg|16px]] [[Cables_CompoundPath|CompoundPath]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[File:Cables_CompoundPath.svg|16px]] CompoundPath}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[File:Cables_CompoundPath.svg|16px]] CompoundPath}} option from the context menu.

==Example== <!--T:19-->

<!--T:20-->
The example shows how to create three different '''CompoundPath'''s by using base wires marking the beginning, middle and end of path. Gaps between individual wires are filled in automatically. In addition the middle wire is used by all three paths with a different offset. For details see the example document file: [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/examples/Harness%20examples/compoundPath_x3.FCStd compoundPath_x3.FCStd].

==Notes== <!--T:22-->

<!--T:23-->
* Note 1: The following wire objects can be safely used for selection as base: [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]], [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] or another existing [[Cables_CompoundPath|CompoundPath]]. Other objects containing '''Points''' property (e.g. [[Draft_BSpline|Draft BSpline]], [[Draft_BezCurve|Draft BezCurve]]) can also be used, but results can be different from the expected outcome (especially when '''Path Type''' property has value: {{Value|Complex}}). Using other objects (e.g.[[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketches]]) can be successful when '''Path Type''' property has value: {{Value|Simple}}. However [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or [[Cables_CableConduit|Cable Conduit]] creation can fail if there are e.g. gaps between such objects.
* Note 2: There can be some unexpected shape results or errors especially when using '''Connection Offset Dist''' property with relatively high values. When troubleshooting such a shape it is recommended to start with '''Connection Offset Dist''' set to 0 and other parameters close to defaults and increase these values with small steps trying to understand what is happening.
