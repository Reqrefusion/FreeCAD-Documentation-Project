=== Create a TechDraw Template — Inkscape v1.4.2 (2025-05-13) ===

* Create a new SVG document
* Setup the size and orientation of the paper
* If present, delete all layers and use the flat workspace only
* From the menu use Edit -> XML-Editor (Shift + Control + T)
* Within the root (topmost) item <svg ...> search for the following attribute:
:{{Code|code=
xml:space = "preserve"
}}
* Change the attribute to the following:
:{{Code|code=
xmlns:freecad = "https://www.freecad.org/wiki/index.php?title=Svg_Namespace"
}}


* Optional: Save a copy of the document as Inkscape template for FreeCAD papers


* On the workspace add standard text that should be editable
* Use the XML-Editor to add an attribute to each editable text item:
:{{Code|code=
freecad:editable = "SomeFieldIdentifier"
}}
* Save the document — this is the Inkscape SVG — don't use it in FreeCAD
* Save a copy of the document as Plain SVG — don't use Inkscape SVG (In fact this is the export from Inkscape to FreeCAD; don't get confused by the fact that both formats have the same file ending.)
* Move the plain SVG to the FreeCAD template folder:
:{{Code|code=
<FreeCAD>\data\Mod\TechDraw\Templates
}}
* Open the template file in TechDraw
