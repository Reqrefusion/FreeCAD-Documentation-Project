==Overview==

Follow-up to the '''Thread: List of firms/companies/organizations that use FreeCAD in Production or in their workflow''' ([https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=43604 forum thread]) this wiki page has been created to tracker all for-profit and non-profit public and private sector usage of FreeCAD in a production environment. The main intention is to debunk the stigma/perception that FreeCAD isn't stable or reliable enough to run in a production environment.

==How to Contribute==

In order to add anything to this list it needs to be vetted by the community. Non-vetted edits will be removed and the user banned for not complying with anti-spamming policies. The template to add an organization is as follows:

{{Code|code=
* '''Organization Name''' - ([https://url.to.website website-name]) - For profit/Non-Profit - 2-3 line summary of what the company does and how it uses FreeCAD in its workflow.
:'''Links:'''
:* URL showing company using FreeCAD
:* Financial documents (non-profits in the US must disclose their finances)
:* other interesting links, perhaps the company's commitment to open source etc... 
}}
