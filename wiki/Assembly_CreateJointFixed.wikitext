==Description== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
The [[Image:Assembly_CreateJointFixed.svg|24px]] [[Assembly_CreateJointFixed|Assembly CreateJointFixed]] tool creates a joint locking two assembly parts together, preventing any movement or rotation.

==Usage== <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
# Optionally select two geometric entities of two different parts. Other selections will be rejected.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:

# Optionally check the '''Show advanced offsets''' check box to fine-tune the placement of each connector relative to its related entity.
#* Two buttons labelled '''Offset1''' and '''Offset2''', each displaying an attachment offset, are added to the dialog.
#* Optionally press the '''Offset1''' button to open the [[Placement|Placement]] dialog.
#*: This allows to adjust the attachment offset of the first connector to its related entity.
#* Optionally press the '''Offset2''' button to open the [[Placement|Placement]] dialog.
#*: This allows to adjust the attachment offset of the second connector to its related entity.
#* The Parts are moved to new offset positions according to their selected entities and the attachment offsets.
# Press {{Button|OK}} to finish the tool.

==Notes== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
* Each joint connects two parts of an assembly and connectors attached to one geometric entity of each part are used to mark the positions to match by the solver.
* Connectors are in fact local coordinate systems and thus marked by a symbol made of three axes (X, Y, Z), and a circle (XY plane). By default, they are only visible while the related dialog is opened. They are permanently visible if their visibility is switched on manually.
* For a joint the second connector superimposes the first connector by default and will change its position according to its type once other joints get involved.
* Hovering the mouse pointer over a geometric entity in the [[3D_view|3D view]], while the dialog is opened, and fewer than two entities are listed, previews where the connector will be placed once the entity is selected.

==Properties== <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
See also: [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

<!--T:12-->
A '''Fixed''' object is derived from an [[App_FeaturePython|App FeaturePython]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

{{TitleProperty|Joint}}

<!--T:15-->
* {{PropertyData|Activated|Bool}}: This indicates if the joint is active.
* {{PropertyData|Distance|Float}}: This stores the '''Distance''' of the Distance joint. It is also used by the RackPinion and Screw joints to store the '''Pitch radius''', and by the Gear, and Belt joints to store '''Radius1'''.
* {{PropertyData|Distance2|Float}}: This is the second distance of the joint. It is used only by the Gear and Belt joints to store '''Radius2'''.
* {{PropertyData|Joint Type|Ennumeration}}: The type of the joint. ({{Value|Fixed}}, {{Value|Revolute}}, {{Value|Cylindrical}}, {{Value|Slider}}, {{Value|Ball}}, {{Value|Distance}}, {{Value|Parallel}}, {{Value|Perpendicular}}, {{Value|Angle}}, {{Value|RackPinion}}, {{Value|Screw}}, {{Value|Gears}}, {{Value|Belt}})
Removed properties (v.1.0.0-RC-38728) These were the properties that could be used to animate:

{{TitleProperty|Joint Connector 2}}

<!--T:19-->
* {{PropertyData|Detach2|Bool}}: This prevents placement2 from recomputing, enabling custom positioning of the placement.
