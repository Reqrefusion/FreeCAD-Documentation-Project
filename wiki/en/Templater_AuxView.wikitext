==Description==

The [[Image:Templater_AuxView.svg|32px]] '''Templater AuxView''' tool adds an auxiliary view to the active TechDraw drawing page based on a straight line in an existing base view. This line, together with the Z-axis of the base view, defines the orientation of the auxiliary view. The end vertices of the line can either be selected separately or derived from a selected edge.
