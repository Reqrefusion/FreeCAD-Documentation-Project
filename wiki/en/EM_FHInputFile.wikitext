==Description==

The FHInputFile tool creates the input FastHenry file based on the Document EM workbench objects.

==Usage==

To create a FastHenry input file:

# Create one [[EM_FHSolver|EM FHSolver]] object and other EM workbench objects representing the 3D geometry as required for your model.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:EM_FHInputFile.svg|16px]] [[EM_FHInputFile|EM FHInputFile]]}} button, or press {{KEY|E}} then {{KEY|I}} keys.

===Remarks===

* In case a file with the same name in the given folder as specified in the [[EM_FHSolver|EM FHSolver]] object already exists, you will be prompted to overwrite or not.

* The Document can also contain non-EM Workbench objects. They will be ignored when creating the FastHenry input file. So you can use any other kind of FreeCAD object as guide for your EM Workbench models.

==Scripting==

See also: [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The FHInputFile command can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=
node = createFHInputFile(doc=None,filename=None,folder=None)
}}

* Outputs a FastHenry input file based on the active document geometry.
* {{incode|doc}} is the Document object that must contain at least one EM_FHSolver object and the relevant geometry. If no {{incode|doc}} is given, the active document is used, if any.
* {{incode|filename}} is the filename to use. If not passed as an argument, the {{PropertyData|Filename}} property of the FHSolver object contained in the document will be used. If the {{PropertyData|Folder}} string in the FHSolver object is empty, the function builds a filename concatenating the document name with the default extension {{incode|EMFHSOLVER_DEF_FILENAME}}.
* {{incode|folder}} is the folder where the file will be stored. If not passed as an argument, the {{PropertyData|Folder}} property of the FHSolver object contained in the document will be used. If the {{PropertyData|Folder}} string in the FHSolver object is empty, the function defaults to the user's home path (e.g. in Windows "C:\Users\username\Documents", in Linux "/home/username")

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, EM

fhsolver = EM.createFHInputFile()
}}
