==Introduction==

The [[Image:Workbench_Points.svg|24px]] [[Points_Workbench|Points Workbench]] offers specific tools for working with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud point clouds]. The workbench is still in development.

A point cloud is a collection of points in 3D space. A point cloud is generally produced by scanning the surface of a solid object. The cloud of points can then be used for many purposes including building a mesh for the object, reconstructing the surfaces and solid volumes, reverse engineering, as well as for visualization and quality inspection.

==Tools==

All Points Workbench tools can be accessed from the '''Points''' menu and the '''Points Tools''' toolbar.

* [[Image:Points_Import.svg|32px]] [[Points_Import|Import Points…]]: Imports a point cloud from a file.

* [[Image:Points_Export.svg|32px]] [[Points_Export|Export Points…]]: Exports a point cloud to a file.

* [[Image:Points_Convert.svg|32px]] [[Points_Convert|Convert to Points]]: Creates point clouds from shape objects.

* [[Image:Points_Structure.svg|32px]] [[Points_Structure|Structured Point Cloud]]: Creates a structured point cloud from the points of an existing point cloud.

* [[Image:Points_Merge.svg|32px]] [[Points_Merge|Merge Point Clouds]]: Creates a point cloud by combining the points of two or more point clouds.

* [[Image:Points_PolyCut.svg|32px]] [[Points_PolyCut|Cut Point Cloud]]: Cuts points from point clouds.

==Notes==

* [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] commands such as [[Image:Draft_Line.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]] and [[Image:Draft_BSpline.svg|16px]] [[Draft_BSpline|Draft B-spline]] can be used to connect the points in a point cloud. Use [[Image:Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Draft Snap Endpoint]] to snap to the points.
* [[Python|Python]] can be used to analyze and process point clouds. See the following forum discussions:
