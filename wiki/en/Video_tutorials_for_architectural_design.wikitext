{{VeryImportantMessage|Please pay attention to the version of FreeCAD used in the tutorial. If a tutorial uses an older version of the program, the general modelling process may still work but some tools may have changed in newer releases. Do not add videos made with version 0.16 or older, as these releases are considered obsolete.}}

== Introduction ==

The tutorials listed here are those that deal with designing rooms, houses, and other buildings which interesting for architects and civil engineers. For other topics, see the general page [[video_tutorials|video tutorials]].

Visit [[tutorials|tutorials]] for high quality written tutorials. A complete, unsorted list of tutorials can be found in [[:Category:Tutorials]].

== Architectural design ==

Videos that go through modeling of rooms, houses, office buildings, and similar structures, and drawing floor plans, using workbenches such as [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] and [[Image:Workbench_BIM.svg|24px]] [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]].

The videos demonstrate importing geometry from a DXF file, then go on to draw the walls, the windows, the glass panels, the structural elements and roofs, the floor tiles, the terrain, the footings and the stairs. Then it shows how to export the model to IFC, how to create 2D projections in TechDraw, how to work with quantities and schedules, and finally how to create a rendered view of the project in Blender.

It starts by importing various DXF files for floor and elevation views that can be used as reference, and then proceeds to model the 3D objects such as walls, concrete structures, roofs, windows, and stairs. The series has two types of videos: long videos that show the modelling process in detail, and shorter videos that speed through the process to show the general steps taken in the long video.
