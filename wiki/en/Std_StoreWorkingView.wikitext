==Description==

The '''Std StoreWorkingView''' command stores the camera settings of the active [[3D_View|3D View]] in its temporary working view. This view can be recalled with the [[Std_RecallWorkingView|Std RecallWorkingView]] command.

Each 3D View has its own working view. Storing a new working view will overwrite the existing working view of the active 3D View. When a 3D View is closed its working view is lost.

==Usage==

# Make sure a [[3D_View|3D View]] is active.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|View → Standard Views → Store Working View}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|Shift}}+{{KEY|End}}.
