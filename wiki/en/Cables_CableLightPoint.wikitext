==Description==

New concept of Cable Light Point Preset and SuppLines child object: <span style="color:blue;">introduced in version 0.3.0</span>

The [[Image:Cables_CableLightPoint.svg|24px]] [[Cables_CableLightPoint|Cable Light Point]] creates a parametric light point object. The light point is a simple ring symbolizing the point where a cable exits from e.g. the wall to connect a light source (e.g. a lamp). It has default size upon creation, but some parameters, like '''Diameter''', '''Height''' or '''Thickness''' can be changed later. The '''Cable Light Point''' belongs to the [[Arch_Component|Arch Component]] class and inherits all of its properties. The '''Cable Light Point''' has [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] child object with two crosses. Each [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] cross can be used as attachment supports for cable passing through the ring. [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] object is not a part of Cable Light Point shape, it is a separate child object also visible in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].

'''Cable Light Point''' object can be colored by attaching desired [[Arch_SetMaterial|Material]] to the '''Material''' property.

==Usage==

# Select the vertex, point on surface or object in the [[3D_View|3D View]] or select nothing.
# Create Cable Light Point by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Cables_CableLightPoint.svg|16px]] [[Cables_CableLightPoint|Cable Light Point]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cables → [[Image:Cables_CableLightPoint.svg|16px]] Cable Light Point}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cables → [[Image:Cables_CableLightPoint.svg|16px]] Cable Light Point}} option from the context menu.

Once created the Cable Light Point is placed at the position of selected vertex, point or object in the 3D space (or at the point (0,0,0) if nothing was selected).

==Notes==

* The [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] objects have reversed relation with their '''Cable Light Point''' parent to avoid cyclic dependencies. They are shown as a children in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] only for visual organization of objects. Undesirable consequence: when the '''Cable Light Point''' is copied, all its child SuppLines objects must always be manually copied with it.
* [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] child object is created automatically, its shape and placement is controlled by '''Cable Light Point'''.

==Properties==

A '''Cable Light Point''' object shares the common properties and behaviors of all [[Arch_Component|Arch Components]].

===Data===

{{TitleProperty|Cable Light Point}}

* {{PropertyData|Claim Children|Bool}}: If set to {{TRUE}} it will claim the linked SuppLines as children in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] (<span style="color:blue;">introduced in version 0.3.3</span>).
* {{PropertyData|Diameter|Length}}: Specifies the outer diameter of the ring. The default diameter is 20 mm.
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: Specifies the height of the ring. The default height is 5 mm.
* {{PropertyData|Preset|Enumeration}}: Specifies the predefined set of parameters for Cable Light Point. The default preset is {{Value|Customized}}. This property is currently not used.
* {{PropertyData|Thickness|Length}}: Specifies the wall thickness of the ring. The default thickness is 2 mm.

==Typical workflow==

The way of building a '''Cable Light Point''' is very similar to the [[Cables_CableBox#Typical workflow|Cable Box Typical workflow]] or [[Cables_CableConnector#Typical workflow|Cable Connector Typical workflow]]
