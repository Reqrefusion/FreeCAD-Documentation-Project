==Introduction==

To start the '''Preferences editor''' select the {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences...}} option from the menu or ({{Version|1.1}}) use the keyboard shortcut {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|,}}. On macOS the {{MenuCommand|Preferences...}} option appears in the {{MenuCommand|FreeCAD}} menu instead (this is the default place for preferences on the Mac).

FreeCAD uses a workbench concept, where each workbench is responsible for specific tasks and functions. A workbench can have its own preferences. These will only appear in the Preferences editor, usually in a dedicated group, if the workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session. Some workbenches add support for specific import and export formats. If there are any related preferences they will appear on one or more additional pages in the [[#Import-Export|Import-Export]] group of the Preferences editor.

To preserve resources, FreeCAD does not automatically load all available workbenches. See [[#Workbenches|Workbenches]] for more information. For a list of workbench related preferences see [[#Workbench_related_preferences|Workbench related preferences]].

If no workbench is loaded, seven groups appear in the Preferences editor: [[#General|General]], [[#Display|Display]], [[#Workbenches|Workbenches]], [[#Python|Python]], [[#Addon_Manager|Addon Manager]], [[#Import-Export|Import-Export]] and [[#Measure|Measure]]. Any workbenches that have been loaded, and have their own preferences, will appear below these.

Pressing the {{Button|Reset}} button in the lower left corner of the Preferences dialog opens a menu ({{Version|1.0}}) with options to reset preferences to their default values. You can reset the current page, the current group, or all preferences. In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the button will reset '''all''' preferences.

Some advanced preferences can only be changed in the [[Std_DlgParameter|Parameter editor]]. The [[Fine-tuning|Fine-tuning]] page lists some of them.

This page has been updated for version 1.0.

==General==

This preferences group has seven pages: General, Document, Selection, Cache, Notification Area, Report view and Help.

In {{VersionMinus|0.21}} the seventh page, Help, is only available if the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Help Help Addon] has been [[Std_AddonMgr|installed]].

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Use OpenGL VBO (Vertex Buffer Object)}}
| If checked, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_Buffer_Object Vertex Buffer Objects] (VBO) will be used. A VBO is an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL OpenGL] feature that provides methods for uploading vertex data (position, normal vector, color, etc.) to the graphics card. VBOs offer substantial performance gains because the data resides in the graphics memory rather than the system memory and so it can be rendered directly by the GPU. For more background info see [https://www.haroldserrano.com/blog/understanding-opengl-objects Understanding OpenGL Objects].
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Render Cache}}

* '''Auto''': Let Coin3D decide where to cache (default).
* '''Distributed''': Manually turn on cache for all view provider root nodes.
* '''Centralized''': Manually turn off cache in all nodes of all view providers, and only cache at the scene graph root node. This offers the fastest rendering speed, but slower response to any scene changes.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Anti-Aliasing}}
| Specifies if and what type of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing multisample anti-aliasing] is used
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Transparent objects}}
| Specifies the render type of transparent objects. The options are:
* '''One pass''': Rendering is done in one pass (default). This can lead to triangular artifacts. If these occur the type '''Backface pass''' can be used to avoid them.
* '''Backface pass''': Rendering is done in two passes. Back-facing polygons are rendered in the first pass and front-facing polygons in the second pass.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Marker size}}
| Specifies the size of [[Glossary#Vertex|vertices]] (points) in the [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. The clickable area of points can be additionally enlarged by increasing the {{MenuCommand|Pick radius}}.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Eye to eye distance for stereo modes}}
| Specifies the eye-to-eye distance used for stereo projections. The specified value is a factor that will be multiplied with the [[Property_editor#View|bounding box]] size of the 3D object that is currently displayed.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Backlight color}}
| If checked, backlight is enabled with the defined color. Backlight is used for rendering the back sides of faces. Usually, you don't see them in solids, unless you slice one with a clipping plane, or if the faces aren't oriented correctly. It is only used for objects whose Lighting property (on the View tab) is set to '''One side'''. If disabled, the back side of the faces of those objects will be black.
The related {{MenuCommand|Intensity}} setting specifies the intensity of the backlight.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Camera type}}
| Specifies the camera projection type. The options are:
* '''Perspective rendering''': Objects will appear in a [[Std_PerspectiveCamera|perspective projection]].
* '''Orthographic rendering''': Objects will be appear in an [[Std_OrthographicCamera|orthographic projection]].

|-
| {{MenuCommand|Intensity}}
| Move the slider to change the intensity of the light.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Direction}}
| The preview shows the XY plane and a sphere, indicating the light source, connected by a line to a cone, indicating the direction. All elements in the preview, the sphere, the small cone directly attached to it, the line and the large cone, can be dragged to change the direction of the light. For more precision the direction vector can be set by specifying the {{MenuCommand|x}}, {{MenuCommand|y}} and {{MenuCommand|z}} values or the {{MenuCommand|q0}} - {{MenuCommand|q3}} [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion quaternion] values.
