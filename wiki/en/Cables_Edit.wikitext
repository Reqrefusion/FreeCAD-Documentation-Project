==Description==

The [[File:Cables_Edit.svg|24px]] [[Cables_Edit|Cables Edit]] command is an extended version of the [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] command which is compatible with the [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] objects. It preserves all properties of '''WireFlex''' (especially points attachments) while adding or removing vertexes. Editing can be performed with non zero '''Fillet Radius''' property and with any value of '''Path Type''' property.
While in '''Cables Edit''' mode, all '''WireFlex''' editing commands can be executed using node or edge context menu: [[Cables_AddVertex|Add Vertex]], [[Cables_DelVertex|Delete Vertex]], [[Cables_AttachVertex|Attach Vertex]], [[Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment|Remove Vertex Attachment]].

The '''Cables Edit''' command was not available in Cables Workbench version 0.1.4 and earlier.

==Usage==

# Optionally select one or more [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] objects. Note that although multiple objects can be in Cables Edit mode, objects can only be edited one at a time.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* If you have not yet selected an object: double-click an object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. This only works for [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] objects.
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Cables_Edit.svg|16px]] [[Cables_Edit|Edit]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[File:Cables_Edit.svg|16px]] Edit}} command from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|D}} then {{KEY|E}}.
#* For a single object: right-click in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[File:Cables_Edit.svg|16px]] Edit}} option from the context menu.

The next steps and options are the same as in [[Draft_Edit#Usage|Draft Edit]].

==Notes==
* Do not use [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] command to edit '''WireFlex''' objects. It can destroy proper order of point attachments and cause errors and unexpected behaviour of these objects.

==Options==

The basic options are the same as in [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]]. Context menu for node or edge is invoked using the same method as in '''Draft Edit'''.

Here are the node or edge context menu specific only for [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]].

# Node context menu: {{Value|Attach point}} - [[Cables_AttachVertex|AttachVertex]] command is executed. One external vertex has to be selected first and then keeping the {{KEY|CTRL}} pressed use the {{Value|Attach point}} context menu (e.g. by holding down {{KEY|ALT}} key and clicking or double clicking the node). This option is visible only for not attached point.
# Node context menu: {{Value|Remove point attachment}} - [[Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment|RemoveVertexAttachment]] command is executed. This option is visible only for attached point.
# Edge context menu: {{Value|Make edge horizontal}} - Makes the edge horizontal by moving the vertex which is closer to the mouse cursor.
# Edge context menu: {{Value|Make edge vertical}} - Makes the edge vertical by moving the vertex which is closer to the mouse cursor.
