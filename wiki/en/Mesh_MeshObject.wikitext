==Description==

A [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]], or formally a {{incode|Mesh::MeshObject}}, is a class that defines a mesh data structure in the software. This is similar to the [[Part_TopoShape|Part TopoShape]] but for [[Mesh|meshes]].

Meshes are normally created with the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]], or imported from STL, OBJ, and similar mesh file formats.

Please note that the {{Button|[[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|16px]] [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]]}} also uses meshes, but in this case, it uses a different data structure, called [[FEM_Mesh|FEM FemMesh]] ({{incode|Fem::FemMesh}} class). This information does not apply to FEM meshes.

== Usage ==

The Mesh MeshObject is an object that is assigned to some [[App_DocumentObject|App DocumentObjects]].

In particular, the basic object that handles these types of attributes is the [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] ({{incode|Mesh::Feature}} class). All objects derived from this class will have access to a Mesh MeshObject.

The most notable objects that will have a Mesh MeshObject are the following:
* Any primitive mesh created with the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]].
* Any object created by importing an STL, OBJ, and similar mesh format files.

== Scripting ==

See also: [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]], and [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]]. For a full list of attributes and methods, consult the [[Source_documentation|source documentation]], and the [[Std_PythonHelp|Std PythonHelp]] tool.

All objects derived from {{incode|Mesh::Feature}} will have a [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]], which is normally accessible from its {{incode|Mesh}} attribute.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Mesh::Cube", "Cube")
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
print(obj.Mesh)
}}

A MeshObject has many attributes (variables) and methods that contain information about it, and which allow doing operations with it. These variables and methods can be tested in the [[Python_console|Python console]].

{{Code|code=
print(obj.Mesh.Area)
print(obj.Mesh.BoundBox)
print(obj.Mesh.CountPoints)
print(obj.Mesh.Volume)

obj.Mesh.copy()
obj.Mesh.countComponents()
obj.Mesh.getEigenSystem()
obj.Mesh.write("my_file.stl")
}}
