==Description==

Cuts through a surface and makes the crossection available. Normal vector and position can be freely chosen to get the desired cut.

This command is similar to [[Part_CrossSections|Part CrossSections]], but it is fully parametric and has an option to reduce the complexity of the output curve. It tries to remove overlapping edges.
