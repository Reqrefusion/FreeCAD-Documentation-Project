==Description==

The [[Image:Cables_AttachWireToTerminal.svg|24px]] [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire To Terminal]] attaches two initial or two final vertices of [[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|24px]] [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] to existing [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]]. Attachments of vertices are kept in special properties of WireFlex, for details see [[Cables_WireFlex#Properties|WireFlex Properties]].

The electrical connection between terminal and wire is established. The terminal properties from the '''Net''' group are updated accordingly.

Once attached the connected wire vertices keep the same position in 3D space as the CableTerminal to which they are attached to. When the CableTerminal is moved, the attached wire vertices move together with it. When the wire is edited in the [[Cables_Edit|Cables Edit]] the attached vertices can not be moved. They jump back to their attached position.

This tool prevents more than one wire from being connected to a single CableTerminal segment. To enable the connection of more wires to a single terminal, the number of its segments must be increased first by changing the [[Cables_CableTerminal#Data|{{PropertyData|Number Of Connections}}]] property.

==Usage==

There are several selection methods to perform [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire To Terminal]] command. Each selection method can give different results after running the command:

# Use one of the [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] selection methods:
#* Select first or last vertex of WireFlex object in the [[3D_View|3D View]].
#* Select an edge close to first or last vertex of WireFlex object in the [[3D_View|3D View]].
# Use one of the [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] selection methods holding the {{KEY|CTRL}}:
#* Select one CableTerminal vertex in the [[3D_View|3D View]] (selected vertex will be the entry point of the wire).
#* Select one CableTerminal edge (segment) in the [[3D_View|3D View]] (first free segment and its vertex with a lower index will be the entry point of the wire).
# Run an [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire To Terminal]] command by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Cables_AttachWireToTerminal.svg|16px]] [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire To Terminal]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[Image:Cables_AttachWireToTerminal.svg|16px]] Attach Wire To Terminal}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[Image:Cables_AttachWireToTerminal.svg|16px]] Attach Wire To Terminal}} option from the context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|T}} then {{KEY|A}}.

==Notes==

* If the [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] object has less then 4 vertices, the missing ones will be added automatically.
* See the [[Cables_WireFlex#Description|WireFlex Description]] and [[Cables_WireFlex#Usage|WireFlex Usage]] for the details how to use WireFlex.
* If a [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] is built upon connected [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] some of their properties may need to be adjusted manually for the connection to display correctly (see [[Cables_CableTerminal#Notes|CableTerminal Notes]]).
