{{GuiCommand
|Name=OpenSCAD ResizeMeshFeature
|MenuLocation=OpenSCAD → Resize Mesh Feature
|Workbenches=[[OpenSCAD_Workbench|OpenSCAD]]
}}

==Description== 

Creates a new resized Mesh object with independent sizing for each axis.

==Usage== 

# Select the Mesh object to be resized.
# Select the {{MenuCommand|OpenSCAD → [[Image:OpenSCAD_ResizeMeshFeature.svg|16px]] Resize Mesh Feature}} option from the menu.
# Enter the resizing value.
# A new Mesh object is created and resized, the original object is rendered hidden.

==Limitations== 

* The new Mesh object is not parametric to the original mesh object, which means any changes to the original object do not get reflected in the new mirrored object.

==Notes== 

* The function does not modify the existing mesh, but returns a new mesh.

==Scripting==

The function can be accessed via Python:

{{Code|code=
import OpenSCADUtils
import Mesh
#this assumes an existing object in the document named "Mesh" that you wish to mirror
original_mesh = App.ActiveDocument.Mesh
resized_mesh = OpenSCADUtils.resizemesh(original_mesh.Mesh, FreeCAD.Base.Vector(100,50,40))
#New mesh would be 100 mm on the x axis, 50 mm on the y axis, and 40 mm on the z axis.
Mesh.show(resized_mesh)
}}
