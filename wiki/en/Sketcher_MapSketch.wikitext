==Description==

The [[Image:Sketcher_MapSketch.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_MapSketch|Sketcher MapSketch]] tool attaches a sketch to selected geometry.

Typical use cases are:
* The sketch was created on a standard plane (XY, XZ or YZ) and you want to attach it to the face of a solid in order to build a new feature upon it.
* The sketch was attached to a specific face of a solid but you need to attached it to a different face.
* A broken model needs to be repaired.
