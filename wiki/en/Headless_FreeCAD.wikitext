== Introduction ==

FreeCAD can be run without its Graphical User Interface (GUI), a mode commonly referred to as 'headless'. This provides several powerful methods for scripting, automation, and embedding its capabilities into other applications. This page documents the various ways to run FreeCAD headlessly.

=== Via the FreeCAD Python Console ===

This is an interactive mode where FreeCAD starts directly in a Python Console. This console is a fully functional Python environment with all of FreeCAD's Python modules, such as {{incode|Part}}, {{incode|BIM}}, and {{incode|Draft}}, accessible through their public API. The core {{incode|FreeCAD}} module is built-in, so it does not need to be imported explicitly during the console session. Other modules can be imported during the session (e.g. {{incode|import Part}}), as needed.

This mode can be launched from the command line using either {{incode|FreeCAD -c}} or {{incode|FreeCADCmd}}. It offers the same functionality as the Python Console found within the full FreeCAD application.

It is best used for quickly testing Python code that accesses the FreeCAD API or for debugging small scripts that can be easily pasted into the console.

=== Via Python script ===

In this mode, FreeCAD is used as a standard Python library. This allows you to import its full Python API into any external Python script or application, treating it as a native module.

To enable this, the Python interpreter must be able to locate the FreeCAD library file, which is named {{incode|FreeCAD.so}} on Linux and macOS or {{incode|FreeCAD.pyd}} on other platforms. This is done by appending its directory to Python's search paths at the very beginning of your script. Once the path is set, the rest of the script can access the FreeCAD API like any other Python module.

Below is a simple example that creates a box and prints its volume and area:

{{Code|code=
# Set the path to your FreeCAD installation
# Example for Linux:
# FREECADPATH = '/usr/lib/freecad/lib'
# Example for macOS:
# FREECADPATH = '/Applications/FreeCAD.app/Contents/Resources/lib'
# Example for Windows:
FREECADPATH = 'C:\\Program Files\\FreeCAD\\bin'
import sys
sys.path.append(FREECADPATH)

# The rest of the script can now import and use the FreeCAD API
import FreeCAD
import Part

# Create a simple geometric shape
my_box = Part.makeBox(10, 20, 30)

# Access its properties
print(f"The volume of the box is: {my_box.Volume}")
print(f"The area of the box is: {my_box.Area}")
}}

To run the example script, save the code into a file (e.g., {{incode|run_box.py}}) and execute it from your system's terminal with the Python interpreter:
{{Code|lang=bash|code=
$ python run_box.py
The volume of the box is: 6000.0
The area of the box is: 2200.0
}}

This is a very powerful feature that unlocks the full capabilities of FreeCAD for automation and integration tasks. For example, one could write a script that leverages both the FreeCAD and Blender APIs to programmatically import objects from a {{incode|.FCStd}} file directly into a Blender scene.

Note that this mode is intended for using the FreeCAD API without a GUI. While some GUI-related modules can be imported, API usage that directly accesses or manipulates GUI components is very limited and generally not supported in a headless context.

See [[Embedding_FreeCAD|Embedding FreeCAD]].

=== Via shell script ===

You can also execute FreeCAD headlessly from a shell script by calling {{incode|FreeCAD -c}} or {{incode|FreeCADCmd}} followed by the necessary arguments.

A full list of available command-line arguments can be displayed by using the {{incode|--help}} flag. Here is an example of the help output for FreeCAD 1.0.2:

  --get-config arg          Prints the value of the requested configuration key
  --set-config arg          Sets the value of a configuration key
  --keep-deprecated-paths   If set then config files are kept on the old 
                            location

Configuration:
  -l [ --write-log ]        Writes FreeCAD.log to the user directory.
  --log-file arg            Unlike --write-log this allows logging to an 
                            arbitrary file
  -u [ --user-cfg ] arg     User config file to load/save user settings
  -s [ --system-cfg ] arg   System config file to load/save system settings
  -t [ --run-test ] arg     Run a given test case (use 0 (zero) to run all 
                            tests). If no argument is provided then return list
                            of all available tests.
  -r [ --run-open ] arg     Run a given test case (use 0 (zero) to run all 
                            tests). If no argument is provided then return list
                            of all available tests.  Keeps UI open after 
                            test(s) complete.

}}
|}

This method is ideal for automated tasks and continuous integration (CI) scripts. Common uses include executing the entire test suite with {{incode|FreeCADCmd -t 0}} or running tests for a specific module, such as {{incode|FreeCADCmd -t TestArch}} (all BIM Workbench tests) or {{incode|FreeCADCmd -t TestArch.TestWall}} (only BIM Workbench's wall tests).

==== Executing Python code directly ====

FreeCAD's command-line executables can also function as specialized Python interpreters, allowing for the direct execution of Python code. This provides a convenient and powerful alternative to embedding FreeCAD within an external Python script.

'''Executing an Inline Script'''

You can pass a string of Python code directly as a single argument. This is useful for very short, single-purpose commands. Note that the command-line argument must not be a path to an existing file for this to work.

* '''Headless Mode''': Using {{incode|FreeCADCmd}} executes the code and then immediately exits. This is ideal for scripting.
{{Code|lang=bash|code=
$ FreeCADCmd "import Part; print(Part.makeBox(10,5,15).Volume)"
}}
* '''Interactive Mode''': Using {{incode|FreeCAD -c}} executes the code and then opens an interactive Python console session. This is useful for quick tests where you may want to inspect the state afterwards.
{{Code|lang=bash|code=
$ FreeCAD -c "import Part; my_box = Part.makeBox(10,5,15)"
}}

'''Executing a Script File'''

A more powerful method is to use FreeCAD to directly execute a Python script file. This is the recommended approach for any non-trivial headless task.

{{Code|lang=bash|code=
$ FreeCADCmd /path/to/my_script.py
}}

When a script is run this way, the FreeCAD environment is already configured. The key advantage is that the script '''does not''' need the {{incode|sys.path.append()}} boilerplate code. The FreeCAD modules are immediately available for import.

For example, a file named {{incode|create_box.py}} could contain:
{{Code|lang=python|code=
import Part
# The FreeCAD module is already available, but it can be imported explicitly
import FreeCAD

# Create a new document and add a box to it
doc = FreeCAD.newDocument()
box_obj = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "MyBox")
doc.recompute()

# Export the part to a STEP file
Part.export([box_obj], "my_box_model.step")

print("Box created and exported successfully to my_box_model.step")
}}
Running this script from the terminal is as simple as:
{{Code|lang=bash|code=
$ FreeCADCmd create_box.py
Box created and exported successfully to my_box_model.step
}}

== Examples ==

=== Searching FreeCAD modules ===

# Open the terminal and type:
#:{{incode|$ /path/to/FreeCAD -c}}
#::or
#:{{incode|$ /path/to/FreeCADCmd}}
# A python shell will start with a prompt. Type {{incode|help()}}.
# A help text is displayed.
# Type {{incode|modules freecad}}.

=== Scenegraph representation ===

As it's not possible to create or access the [[Viewprovider|view provider]] in headless mode. What's possible is to load {{incode|FreeCADGui}} in headless mode but there is no way to access the GUI document because it won't be created and consequently there exist no view providers.

However, what's possible is to create a [[Scenegraph|scenegraph]] representation of an object:

{{Code|lang=python|code=
import FreeCADGui as Gui
from pivy import coin

Gui.setupWithoutGUI()
doc = App.newDocument()
obj = doc.addObject("Part::Box","Box")
doc.recompute()
view = Gui.subgraphFromObject(obj)
}}
