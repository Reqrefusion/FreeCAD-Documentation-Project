== Description ==

The [[Image:Part_Fillet.svg|24px]] '''Part Fillet''' command creates fillets (rounds) on the selected edges of a shape. A dialog allows choosing which shape and which edges to work on.

==Usage==

# Optionally select one or more edges in the [[3D_View|3D View]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Fillet.svg|16px]] [[Part_Fillet|Fillet]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Fillet.svg|16px]] Fillet}} option from the menu.
# The '''Fillet Edges''' [[Task_Panel|task panel]] opens.
#* Optionally (re-) select an item in the '''Selected shape''' list in the '''Shape''' section or in the [[3D_View|3D View]].
#* Edit the fillet parameters.
# Press {{Button|OK}} to close the task panel and apply the fillet.

== Part Fillet VS. PartDesign Fillet ==

There is another fillet command in the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Workbench]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign workbench]]. Please note that their operation is quite different. Check out the [[Image:PartDesign_Fillet.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Fillet]] [[PartDesign_Fillet|PartDesign Fillet]] reference page for more details on their differences.

== Notes on application of Part Fillet ==

Part Fillet might do nothing if the result would touch or cross the next adjacent edge. Consequently, if you do not obtain the expected result, try with a smaller '''Radius''' value. This is the same for [[Image:Part_Chamfer.svg|24px]] [[Part_Chamfer|Part Chamfer]].

The fillet command sometimes fails when trying to fillet complex shapes. A common cause of this may be that the shape being filleted is not geometrically correct. This may be the result of lines/planes etc not being removed after previous operations used to construct the shape ( e.g. Cut/Intersection/Fusion). A number of steps can be used to minimize problems:
* Where possible leave filleting a part until the part is completely generated. This will minimize interaction of fillets with subsequent Boolean operations;
* Use the {{MenuCommand|Part → Check Geometry}} to check for any errors in the shape geometry and correct;
* Use {{MenuCommand|Part → Copy → Refine Shape}} to remove any artifacts introduced by previous Boolean operations before filleting (and in some cases between filleting operations in sequence);
* Consider using {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → Part/Part Design}} to enable automatic checking and refining of the model after Boolean and sketch based operations (performance may be affected if these options are left switched on).
