==Description==

The [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified|Sketcher ConstrainCoincidentUnified]] tool creates a coincident constraint between points, fixes points on edges or axes (lines are then treated as infinite, and open curves are virtually extended as well), or creates a concentric constraint between circles, arcs and/or ellipses (by making their centers coincident).

This tool replaces the [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Sketcher ConstrainCoincident]] and [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|Sketcher ConstrainPointOnObject]] tools if the '''Unify coincident and point-on-object constraints''' option is selected in the [[Sketcher_Preferences#General|preferences]].

==Usage==

See also: [[Sketcher_Workbench#Drawing_aids|Drawing aids]].

===[[Sketcher_Workbench#Continue_modes|Continue mode]]===

# Make sure there is no selection.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified|Coincident Constraint]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Constraints → [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified.svg|16px]] Coincident Constraint}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Constrain → [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified.svg|16px]] Coincident Constraint}} option from the context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|C}}.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Do one of the following:
#* Select two points.
#* Select two edges of circles, arcs, ellipses or arcs of ellipses.
#* Select a single point and a single edge (in any order).
# A constraint is added.
# Optionally keep creating constraints.
# To finish, right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

===Run-once mode===

# Do one of the following:
#* Select two or more points.
#* Select two or more edges of circles, arcs, ellipses or arcs of ellipses.
#* Select a single point and a single edge (in any order).
#* Select several points and a single edge (idem).
#* Select a single point and several edges (idem).
# Invoke the tool as described above, or with the following additional option:
#* Right-click in the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified.svg|16px]] Coincident Constraint}} option from the context menu.
# Depending on the selection one or more constraints are added.

==Notes==

* {{Version|1.0}}: Points with coincident constraints are marked with the '''Constraint symbols''' [[Sketcher_Preferences#Display|color]].
