==Description==

This macro provides a convenient way to export selected FreeCAD objects to multiple file formats at once. Instead of exporting to each format individually, you can select all desired formats in a single dialog and export them simultaneously.

'''Supported Export Formats:'''
* STL - Stereolithography (common for 3D printing)
* STEP - Standard for Exchange of Product Data (CAD interchange)
* 3MF - 3D Manufacturing Format (modern 3D printing format)
* OBJ - Wavefront OBJ (3D graphics and game engines)
* IGES - Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (legacy CAD format)
* BREP - OpenCASCADE native format (preserves exact geometry)
* PLY - Polygon File Format (3D scanning and printing)
* AMF - Additive Manufacturing Format (XML-based 3D printing)

'''Features:'''
* Export to multiple formats in a single operation.
* User-friendly dialog for format selection.
* Configurable output directory and base filename.
* Mesh tolerance settings for STL/OBJ/PLY/3MF/AMF exports.
* Preview of files to be created.
* Quick select buttons: "Select All", "Select None", "Reset Defaults".
* Default formats: STL, STEP, and 3MF are pre-selected.

==Usage==

# Select one or more objects in the 3D view that you want to export.
# Run the macro from '''Macro → Macros → MultiExport → Execute'''.
# In the dialog:
#* Review the selected objects in the "Objects to Export" section.
#* Check the formats you want to export to (STL, STEP, 3MF are selected by default).
#* Choose an output directory using the "Browse..." button.
#* Enter a base filename (the format extension will be appended automatically).
#* Optionally adjust mesh tolerance settings for mesh-based formats.
# Click "Export" to create the files.
