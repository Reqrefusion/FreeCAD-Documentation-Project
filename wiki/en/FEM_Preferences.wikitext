==Introduction==

The preferences for the [[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|24px]] [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]] can be found in the [[Preferences Editor|Preferences Editor]]. In the menu select {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences...}} and then {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Workbench_FEM.svg|16px]] FEM}}. This group is only available if the FEM Workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

There are seven pages: [[#General|General]], [[#Gmsh|Gmsh]], [[#CalculiX|CalculiX]], [[#Elmer|Elmer]], [[#Mystran|Mystran]], [[#Z88|Z88]] and [[#Netgen|Netgen]]. All pages apart from the first control how FEM interacts with external meshers and solvers. 

The currently supported external solvers are:
* [[Image:FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools.svg|32px]] [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX]]
* [[Image:FEM_SolverElmer.svg|32px]] [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer]]
* [[Image:FEM_SolverMystran.svg|32px]] [[FEM_SolverMystran|Mystran]]
* [[Image:FEM_SolverZ88.svg|32px]] [[FEM_SolverZ88|Z88]]

==Elmer==

[[Image:Preferences_FEM_Page_Elmer.png|350px]]

On this page you can specify the following:

{| class="wikitable float-right mw-collapsible mw-uncollapsed"
!style="width: 33%;"|Name
!style="width: 66%;"|Description
|-
| {{MenuCommand|ElmerGrid: Search in known binary directories}}

| {{MenuCommand|ElmerSolver binary path}}

|-
| {{MenuCommand|CPU cores to be used}}
| The number of CPU cores that will be used to perform the solving.
'''Important:''' Elmer divides the mesh into portions. The number of portions is equal to the number of CPU cores used. This can result in side-effects:
* Depending on your mesh a smaller number of CPU cores can run faster than using more cores.
* In some cases using e.g. 12 cores does not converge while 8 cores will work fine. The reason is that at some point the mesh portions become too small.
So it is often necessary to adjust the number of cores, depending on the mesh.

'''Known limitation:''' For some simulation types you first need to install Elmer modules to enable multi-threading. Check the Elmer report for info about this. A typical case is that for direct solving one has to install the MUMPS module.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Filter results}}
| The mesh volume regions processed by each CPU core will be merged to make the volume boundaries invisible.
|-
| {{MenuCommand|Use binary format}}
| If checked, binary results format is used. Otherwise, ASCII format is used. Binary format may cause lack of results due to a bug. {{Version|1.1}}
|-
