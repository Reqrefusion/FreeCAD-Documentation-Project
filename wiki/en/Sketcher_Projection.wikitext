==Description==

The [[Image:Sketcher_Projection.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_Projection|Sketcher Projection]] tool ({{Version|1.1}}) creates a perpendicular projection of edges and/or vertices belonging to objects outside the sketch onto the sketch plane. The projected geometry is called "external geometry". It stays parametrically linked to its source objects. External geometry is marked with a dedicated [[Sketcher_Preferences#Appearance|color]] (default magenta). It can be defining geometry that is visible outside the sketch or construction geometry that is not visible outside the sketch.

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_Projection.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_Projection|External Projection]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketcher → Sketcher Tools → [[Image:Sketcher_Projection.svg|16px]] External Projection}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Sketcher_Projection.svg|16px]] External Projection}} option from the context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|G}} then {{KEY|X}}.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Select one or more external faces, edges and/or vertices. See [[#Notes|Notes]].
# External geometry is created.
# This tool always runs in continue mode: optionally keep selecting external faces, edges and/or vertices.
# To finish, right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

== Notes ==

* All edges of a face are projected onto the sketch plane.
* The global coordinates of the projected elements depend on the position of the external objects and the sketch plane. Moving the sketch along its plane will change the local (sketch) coordinates of the elements, but not their global coordinates.
* External geometry is created as defining geometry or construction geometry according to the status of the [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|Toggle Construction Geometry]] tool. This tool can also be used to toggle the mode of individual edges. Check the {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → Sketcher → General → Always add external geometry as construction}} option to ignore the status of this tool and always add external geometry as construction geometry.
