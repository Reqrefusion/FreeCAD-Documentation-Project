==Description==

Defines a gravity acceleration acting on the whole model in the prescribed direction.

{{VersionMinus|0.21}}: The acceleration has a fixed value of 9.81 m/s^2.

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight.svg|16px]] [[FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight|Gravity Load]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Model → Mechanical Boundary Conditions and Loads → [[Image:FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight.svg|16px]] Gravity Load}} option from the menu.
# A '''ConstraintSelfWeight''' object is created.
# {{Version|1.0}}: Optionally change its {{PropertyData|Gravity Acceleration}} property.
# Optionally change its {{PropertyData|Gravity Direction}} property.

==Scripting==

New object:

{{Code|code=
import ObjectsFem
ObjectsFem.makeConstraintSelfWeight(name)
}}

Add object to the analysis named Analysis:

{{Code|code=
App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member = App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member + [(object)]
}}

Example:

{{Code|code=
import ObjectsFem
selfweight_obj = ObjectsFem.makeConstraintSelfWeight("MySelfWeightObject")
App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member = App.ActiveDocument.Analysis.Member + [selfweight_obj]
}}

== Solver CalculiX ==

===Limitations===

*{{VersionMinus|0.21}}: You need to modify the .inp file to edit gravity acceleration.
*Self-weight is applied to the element set Eall which includes the whole model.

===Editing CalculiX input file===

The acceleration constant can be manually edited after generating the CalculiX input file.

Example of lines in the .inp file:

{{Code|code=
*DLOAD
Eall,GRAV,9810,0.0,0.0,-1.0
}}

where 9810 is a gravity acceleration magnitude in [mm/s^2], and 0,0,-1 is the direction vector. The value can be set as a multiple of standard gravity acceleration to simulate loading of e.g. 4g.

== Solver Z88 ==

* Currently, not implemented in the Z88 solver.
