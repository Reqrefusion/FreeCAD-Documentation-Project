==Description==

This equation performs static current conduction analyses. It solves the electrostatic potential in a conducting medium allowing volume currents and electric power loss ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating Joule heating]) to be derived.

For info about the math of the equation, see the [https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/documentation/ Elmer models manual], section ''Static Current Conduction''.

==Usage==

# Add an [[Image:FEM_SolverElmer.svg|16px|link=FEM_SolverElmer#Equations]] [[FEM_SolverElmer#Equations|Elmer solver]].
# Select it in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_EquationStaticCurrent.svg|16px]] [[FEM_EquationStaticCurrent|Static Current Equation]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Solve → Electromagnetic Equations → [[Image:FEM_EquationStaticCurrent.svg|16px]] Static Current Equation}} option from the menu.
# Change the [[#Solver_Settings|equation's solver settings]] or the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|general solver settings]] if necessary.

==Solver Settings==

For the general solver settings, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|Elmer solver settings]].

The static current equation provides these special settings:
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Joule Heating}}: Calculates the Joule heating.
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Nodal Heating}}: Calculates the nodal heating that can be used to couple the heat equation optimally when using conforming finite element meshes.
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Volume Current}}: Calculates the volume current.
* {{PropertyData|Constant Weights}}: Turns constant weighting on for the results.
* {{PropertyData|Current}}: Current control value.
* {{PropertyData|Current Control}}: Apply current control with the desired current.
* {{PropertyData|Heat Source}}: Use Joule heating as a heat source in combination with heat equation.
* {{PropertyData|Power}}: Power control value.
* {{PropertyData|Power Control}}: Apply power control with the desired heating power.

==Analysis Feature Information==

The static current equation takes the following analysis features into account if they are set:

* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential|Electrostatic potential boundary condition]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity|Current density boundary condition]]

===Note===

Except for calculations in 2D, for [[Image:FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential|electrostatic potential boundary conditions]] it is important that they act on a face or body. Boundary conditions in 3D set to lines or vertices are not recognized by the Elmer solver.

==Results==

The available results depend on the [[#Solver_Settings|solver settings]]. If none of the {{PropertyData|Calculate *}} settings was set to ''true'', only the electric potential is calculated. Otherwise also the corresponding results will be available.

The possible results are:
* Joule heating in <math>\rm W/m^3</math>
* Nodal Joule heating in <math>\rm W</math>
* Volume current in <math>\rm A/m^2</math>
* Potential in <math>\rm V</math>
