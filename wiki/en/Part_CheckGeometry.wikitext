==Description==

The [[Image:Part_CheckGeometry.svg|24px]] '''Part CheckGeometry''' command runs a verification and reports if geometry is a valid solid. The command checks if the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation Boundary representation] (BRep or [[Glossary#B|B-rep]]) of the model is valid.

==Usage==

# Select a part (beware to select the whole part and not just a face to check for valid solid) 
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_CheckGeometry.svg|16px]] [[Part_CheckGeometry|Check Geometry]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_CheckGeometry.svg|16px]] Check Geometry}} option from the menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Settings}} task panel opens, unless {{MenuCommand|Skip this settings page}} is enabled. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information. Click {{Button|Run Check}}.

Results will be reported in the [[Task_Panel|task panel]]. If the check produced errors: click in the report on a specific error message and the corresponding geometric object (edge, face, etc.) will be highlighted in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

==Options==

===Skip this settings page===

If ticked, subsequent invocations of the command skip showing the {{MenuCommand|Settings}} task panel.

===Run boolean operation check===

If ticked, additionally a Boolean OPerations (BOP) check is performed.

===Single-threaded===

Run the geometry check in a single thread. This is slower, but more stable.

===Log errors===

If ticked, any errors found are also logged in the [[Report_View|Report View]].

===Expand shape content===

In addition to detecting potential geometry errors, this command shows a range of properties regarding the selected object:
* Checked object
* Shape type
* Number of geometric entities: vertices, edges, wires, faces, shells, solids, compsolids, compounds, total shapes
* Geometric and mass properties:
** Area
** Volume
** Mass
** Length
** Center of mass
** Orientation
** Symmetry axis
** Symmetry point
** Moments
** First axis of inertia
** Second axis of inertia
** Third axis of inertia
** Radius of gyration
** Global placement

===Advanced shape content===

Show advanced shape content. Changes will take effect next time you use the check geometry command.

===Individual boolean operation checks===

The user can choose the type of boolean operation to be checked:
* Bad type
* Self-intersect
* Too small edge
* Nonrecoverable face
* Continuity
* Incompatibility of face
* Incompatibility of vertex
* Incompatibility of edge
* Invalid curve on surface

==Notes==

* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types and [[App_Part|App Part]] containers with the appropriate visible objects inside can also be checked using this command. For [[App_Link|App Links]] the shape of the linked object is checked. For [[App_Part|App Part]] containers the visible objects within are checked as compounds.
* FreeCAD has no methods to automatically repair geometry. If faults are detected the steps involved to create the model need to be examined and fixed manually.
