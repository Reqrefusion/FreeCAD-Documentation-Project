== Description ==

Macro Honeycomb creates a fully parametric Honeycomb object that is compatible inside and outside of Part Design workbench. The honeycomb grid includes an optional border and can be either oval-shaped (elliptical) or rectangular. It is an update for and eventual replacement of Macro FCHoneycombMaker, which does not produce a feature Python object, but rather relies on a spreadsheet and some Draft arrays.
