==Description==

This equation describes the heat transfer in rigid and fluid bodies.

For information about the math of the equation, see the [https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/documentation/ Elmer models manual], section ''Heat Equation''.

==Usage==

# Add an [[Image:FEM_SolverElmer.svg|16px|link=FEM_SolverElmer#Equations]] [[FEM_SolverElmer#Equations|Elmer solver]].
# Select it in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_EquationHeat.svg|16px]] [[FEM_EquationHeat|Heat Equation]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Solve → [[Image:FEM_EquationHeat.svg|16px]] Heat Equation}} option from the menu.
# Change the [[#Solver_Settings|equation's solver settings]] or the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|general solver settings]] if necessary.

==Solver Settings==

For the general solver settings, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|Elmer solver settings]].

The heat equation provides these special settings:
* {{PropertyData|Bubbles}}: There is also a residual-free-bubbles formulation of the stabilized finite-element method. It is more accurate and does not include any ad hoc terms. However, it may be computationally more expensive. If both {{PropertyData|Bubbles}} and {{PropertyData|[[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Base|Stabilize]]}} are ''false'', no stabilization is used and then the results might easily be nonsensical.</br>'''Note''': If during the ''first solver iteration'' you get this error:</br> ERROR:: IterSolve: Numerical Error: System diverged over maximum tolerance.</br>The {{PropertyData|Bubbles}} method failed. In this case set {{PropertyData|[[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Base|Stabilize]]}} to ''true''.

Equation:
* {{PropertyData|Convection}}: The type of convection to be used in the heat equation.</br>'''Note''': If this is not set to ''None'', {{PropertyData|[[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Base|Stabilize]]}} must be to ''true'' otherwise the convection term will not be considered for the heat equation.
* {{PropertyData|Phase Change Model}}: The model use for phase changes (ice to water etc.). The model ''Spatial 1'' is the apparent-heat-capacity method, ''Spatial 2'' and ''Temporal'' are effective-heat-capacity methods.</br>For more info about the models, see [https://blog.rwth-aachen.de/gfd/files/2017/07/BT_2013_Schueller_elmer_icemole.pdf this paper] (section 2.5.2.2) (is in German). In the paper it was also shown that ''Spatial 1'' has numerical problems on larger temperature gradients and that ''Spatial 2'' was preferred for the phase change ice to water.

==Analysis Feature Information==

The heat equation takes the following analysis features into account if they are set:

* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource|Body heat source]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialTemperature.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialTemperature|Initial temperature condition]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintTemperature.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintTemperature|Temperature boundary condition]]

===Note===

Except for calculations in 2D, for all the above analysis features it is important that they act on a face or a body. Features in 3D set to lines or vertices are not recognized by the Elmer solver.

==Result==

The result is the temperature in Kelvin.
