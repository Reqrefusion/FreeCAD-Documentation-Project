== Introduction ==

The preferences for the [[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw Workbench]] can be found in the [[Preferences Editor|Preferences Editor]]. In the menu select {{MenuCommand|Edit â†’ Preferences...}} and then {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|16px]] TechDraw}}. This group is only available if the TechDraw Workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

There are seven pages: [[#General|General]], [[#Scale|Scale]], [[#Dimensions|Dimensions]], [[#Annotation|Annotation]], [[#Colors|Colors]], [[#HLR|HLR]] and [[#Advanced|Advanced]].

All preferences with ''italic'' labels are default values for new drawing objects. They have no effect on existing objects.

* '''Show UV ISO Lines''': Shows ISO lines. ISO stands for ''isoparametric''. [https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/alias-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2014/ENU/Alias/files/GUID-4CCDF144-DB4F-4BEB-BA5A-E69CED27F4B9-htm.html Here is a description] what isoparametric lines (in fact curves) are.

== Advanced ==

[[Image:Preferences_TechDraw_Page_Advanced.png|thumb|350px|Advanced preferences]]

* '''Allow Crazy Edges''': Includes edges with unexpected geometry in results, e.g. zero lengths.
* '''Validate Shapes''': If checked, input shapes will be checked for errors before use and invalid shapes will be skipped. It can be slower but may prevent crashes. {{Version|1.1}}
* '''Debug Section''': Dumps intermediate results during a Section view processing.
* '''Debug Bad Shape''': If checked, shapes that failed validation will be saved as B-rep files for later analysis. {{Version|1.1}}
* '''Debug Detail''': Dumps intermediate results during a Detail view processing.
* '''Overlap Edges Scrub Passes''': The number of attempts to remove overlapping edges returned by the Hidden Line Removal algorithm. A value of 0 indicates no scrubbing. Values above 2 are generally not productive. Each attempt adds to the time required to produce the drawing. {{Version|0.21}}
* '''Edge Fuzz''': Size of selection area around edges. The fuzz unit is approximately 0.1 mm, depending on your current zoom. The default is 10. Values in the 20-30 range will make it noticeably easier to select edges. Large numbers will cause overlaps with other drawing elements.
* '''Mark Fuzz''': Selection area around center marks. The fuzz unit is approximately 0.1 mm, depending on your current zoom.
* '''Max SVG Hatch Tiles''': The limit of SVG tiles with a size of 64x64 pixels used to hatch a single face. For large scalings one might get an error about to many SVG tiles, then one needs to increase the tile limit.
* '''Max PAT Hatch Segments''': The maximum hatch line segments used when hatching a face with a PAT pattern.
* '''Balloon Drag''': Modifier key for balloon drag can be changed from the default here to avoid conflicts with OS or navigation style key bindings. {{Version|1.0}}
