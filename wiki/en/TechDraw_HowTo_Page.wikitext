== Introduction ==

This page provide a collection of hints and little guides on using the 
[[Image:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|24px|link=TechDraw_Workbench]] [[TechDraw Workbench]]. Adding new findings and best practices is encouraged.

=== Enable/Disable Centermarks===
When the centermarks are disabled hole centers and similar things can not be dimensioned. The centermarks are rendered as a little cross.

* Select the view port (e.g. "Front")
* In the property panel, 'View'' Tab set the value ''Arc Center Marks'' to true

''Note'' in this tab are [[TechDraw View#Properties|other settings]] for the view that might be useful.

=== Toggle View Frame and Vertex dots ===
See [[TechDraw ToggleFrame|here]] for switching them on and off and more information. 

===Curved edges as input to linear dimensions===

Curved edges are accepted as input to linear dimensions. See this [https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=49719&start=30 forum thread]
