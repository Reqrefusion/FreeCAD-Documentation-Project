== Description ==

Animator makes it very easy to animate your models by animating various properties. Available supported properties are kept in a drop down list for your convenience. Select the property to animate and double click the Animator object to start the animation. Double click again to stop the animation or let it complete. By default 100 frames are used with the start value of the property = 0 and the step increment of 1.0 per iteration through the loop. All of this easily configurable from the property view.
