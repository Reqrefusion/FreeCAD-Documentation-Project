== Description == 

The [[Image:Draft_Snap_Near.svg|24px]] '''Draft Snap Near''' option snaps to the nearest point on faces and edges. The faces and edges can belong to [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] or [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]] objects but also to objects created with other [[Workbenches|workbenches]].

== Usage == 

For general information about snapping see [[Draft_Snap|Draft Snap]].

# Make sure snapping is enabled. See [[Image:Draft_Snap_Lock.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Lock|Draft Snap Lock]].
# If '''Draft Snap Near''' is not active do one of the following:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_Snap_Near.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap_Near|Snap Near]]}} button in the Draft Snap toolbar.
#* [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]]: Hold down the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_Snap_Lock.svg|x16px]][[Image:Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg|x16px]]}} button in the [[Draft_Snap_Widget|Draft Snap Widget]] and in the menu that opens select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Draft_Snap_Near.svg|16px]] Snap Near}} option.
#* [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]]: Select the {{MenuCommand|Snapping → [[Image:Draft_Snap_Near.svg|16px]] Snap Near}} option from the menu, or from the [[3D_View|3D View]] context menu.
# Choose a Draft or BIM command to create your geometry.
# Note that you can also change snap options while a command is active.
# Move the cursor over a face or edge.
# The face or edge is highlighted.
# If a nearest point is found the point is marked.
# Optionally move the cursor along the face or edge to select a different nearest point.
# Click to confirm the point.

== Notes ==

* {{VersionMinus|1.0}}: It is not a good idea to have Draft Snap Near permanently active as it takes precedence over many other snap options.
* {{Version|1.1}}: Is is possible to have Draft Snap Near permanently active, but it does mean you have to move the mouse more, and point the mouse more accurately, for other on-object snaps.

== Preferences ==

See [[Draft_Snap#Preferences|Draft Snap]].
