== Introduction ==

In FreeCAD the word "[[Body|Body]]" is normally used to refer to a [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] object ({{incode|PartDesign::Body}} class) that is defined by the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. This is a container object that can hold [[Sketch|2D sketches]] and [[PartDesign Feature|3D geometrical features]] to build a solid shape.

See [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]] for more information about this type of object.

==Usage==

# Switch to the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Body.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Body|PartDesign Body]]}}.
# Press {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_NewSketch|PartDesign NewSketch]]}} to create a new [[Sketch|sketch]].
# Create a closed wire, and then use {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_Pad.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Pad|PartDesign Pad]]}} to extrude the sketch, and create an initial solid.
# Add more sketches and pads, and use other tools of the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] to modify and transform the initial solid.

Alternatively, instead of using [[Sketch|sketches]], you can add primitive [[PartDesign Feature|PartDesign Features]], for example, a {{Button|[[File:PartDesign_AdditiveBox.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_AdditiveBox|PartDesign Additive box]]}}. Any number of additive and subtractive features can be used to create a final volume.

== Notes ==

A Body is required when using the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] in a [[Feature_editing|feature editing]] methodology.

A Body is not required when using the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]], as this workbench uses a [[Constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] workflow, which is based on [[Part_Primitives|primitive shapes]] and boolean operations.
