==Introduction==

This tutorial was originally written by Roland Frank (†2017, r-frank), and it was rewritten and illustrated by vocx.

This tutorial is here to teach you how to use the [[Part Workbench|Part Workbench]].

The Part Workbench was the first workbench developed. It provides the basic geometrical elements that can be used as building blocks for other workbenches. The Part Workbench is meant to be used in a traditional [[constructive solid geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) workflow. For a more modern workflow using sketches, pads, and features, use the [[PartDesign Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].

You will practice:
* inserting primitives
* changing parameters of those primitive objects
* modifying their [[placement|placement]]
* doing boolean operations

== Setup ==

1. Open FreeCAD, create a new empty document with {{MenuCommand|File → [[File:Std_New.svg|16px]] [[Std_New|New Document]]}}, and switch to the [[Part Workbench|Part Workbench]].
:1.1. Press the {{Button|[[File:Std_ViewIsometric.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewIsometric|Isometric]]}} button, or press {{KEY|0}} in the numerical pad of your keyboard, to change the view to isometric to visualize the 3D solids better.
:1.2. Press the {{Button|[[File:Std_ViewFitAll.svg|16px]] [[Std_ViewFitAll|Fit All]]}} button whenever you add objects in order to pan and zoom the [[3D_View|3D View]] so that all elements are seen in the view.
:1.3. Hold {{KEY|Ctrl}} while you click to select multiple items. If you selected something wrong or want to de-select everything, just click on empty space in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

== Insert primitive cubes ==

2. Insert a primitive cube by clicking on {{Button|[[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] [[Part_Box|Cube]]}}.
:2.1. Select {{incode|Cube}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]].
:2.2. Change the dimensions in the {{MenuCommand|Data}} tab of the [[Property_View|Property View]].
:2.3. Change {{MenuCommand|Length}} to {{incode|90 mm}}.
:2.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Width}} to {{incode|90 mm}}.
:2.5. Change {{MenuCommand|Height}} to {{incode|90 mm}}.

3. In the {{MenuCommand|Data}} tab of the [[Property_View|Property View]], click on the {{MenuCommand|Placement}} value so the ellipsis button {{Button|…}} appears on the right.
:3.1. Press on the ellipsis to launch the [[Std_Placement|Placement]] dialog.
:3.2. Change the {{MenuCommand|Translation}} values.
:3.3. Change {{MenuCommand|X}} to {{incode|-45 mm}}.
:3.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Y}} to {{incode|-45 mm}}.
:3.5. Change {{MenuCommand|Z}} to {{incode|-45 mm}}.
:3.6. Press the {{Button|OK}} button to close the dialog.

4. Repeat the process, inserting a second, smaller cube by clicking on {{Button|[[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] [[Part_Box|Cube]]}}.
:4.1. The second cube will be created with the same name, but with an additional number to distinguish the object.
:4.2. Select {{incode|Cube001}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and change the dimensions and placement like with the previous object.
:4.3. Change {{MenuCommand|Length}} to {{incode|80 mm}}.
:4.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Width}} to {{incode|80 mm}}.
:4.5. Change {{MenuCommand|Height}} to {{incode|80 mm}}.

:7.5. Open the [[Std_Placement|Placement]] dialog.
:7.6. Change {{MenuCommand|Y}} to {{incode|60 mm}}.
:7.7. Change the {{MenuCommand|Rotation}} to {{incode|Rotation axis with angle}}; {{MenuCommand|Axis}} to {{incode|X}} (by setting the {{incode|X}}, {{incode|Y}} and {{incode|Z}} values of the axis inputboxes to {{incode|1}}, {{incode|0}} and {{incode|0}} respectively), and {{MenuCommand|Angle}} to {{incode|90 deg}}.
:7.8. Press the {{Button|OK}} button to close the dialog.

8. Insert another cylinder. This time create a duplicate so that the radius and height don't have to be changed, only its placement.
:8.1. Select {{incode|Cylinder001}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and go to the menu {{MenuCommand|Edit → [[Std_DuplicateSelection|Duplicate Selection]]}}. This will create {{incode|Cylinder002}}.

:8.5. Press the {{Button|OK}} button to close the dialog.

== Change visual properties ==

9. The previous operations create three cylinders that intersect each other, and also intersect the cubes. To visualize this better we can modify the {{MenuCommand|View}} properties in the [[Property_View|Property View]].
:9.1. Select {{incode|Cube001}}, the smaller cube, in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and change the transparency. In the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, change the value of {{MenuCommand|Transparency}} to {{incode|70}}.
:9.2. Select {{incode|Cylinder}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, click on the {{MenuCommand|Shape Appearance}} value to open the {{MenuCommand|Select Color}} dialog, then choose a red color.

== Fuse and cut ==

10. In the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], select {{incode|Cube001}} (the inner, smaller cube), and the three cylinders, then press {{Button|[[File:Part_Fuse.svg|16px]] [[Part_Fuse|Union]]}}. This will create a {{incode|Fusion}} object.

11. Then perform a boolean cut of the {{incode|Cube}} (larger cube) and the new {{incode|Fusion}} object.
:11.1. In the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] select {{incode|Cube}} first, and then {{incode|Fusion}}.
:11.2. Then press {{Button|[[File:Part_Cut.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cut|Cut]]}}. This will create a {{incode|Cut}} object.
:{{Emphasis|Note:}} the order in which you select the objects is important for the cut operation. The base object is selected first, and the subtracting object comes at the end.
:11.3. If the colors look strange, select the new {{incode|Cut}} object, go to the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, click on the {{MenuCommand|Shape Appearance}} value to open the {{MenuCommand|Select Color}} dialog, then choose a gray color; also change the value of {{MenuCommand|Line Width}} to {{incode|2.0}}.

:12.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Height}} to {{incode|112 mm}}.
:12.5. Open the [[Std_Placement|Placement]] dialog.
:12.6. Change {{MenuCommand|X}} to {{incode|-70 mm}}.
:12.7. Change {{MenuCommand|Y}} to {{incode|-56 mm}}.
:12.8. Change {{MenuCommand|Z}} to {{incode|-56 mm}}.
:12.9. Press {{Button|OK}}.

13. Click on {{Button|[[Image:Part_Box.svg|16px]] [[Part_Box|Cube]]}}.
:13.1. Select {{incode|Cube003}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and change the dimensions and placement.
:13.2. Change {{MenuCommand|Length}} to {{incode|180 mm}}.
:13.3. Change {{MenuCommand|Width}} to {{incode|180 mm}}.
:13.4. Change {{MenuCommand|Height}} to {{incode|180 mm}}.
:13.5. Open the [[Std_Placement|Placement]] dialog.
:13.6. Change {{MenuCommand|X}} to {{incode|-90 mm}}.
:13.7. Change {{MenuCommand|Y}} to {{incode|-90 mm}}.
:13.8. Change {{MenuCommand|Z}} to {{incode|-90 mm}}.
:13.9. Press {{Button|OK}}.

We'll duplicate the previous two objects again to use once more as cutting objects.

14. Select only {{incode|Cube002}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and go to {{MenuCommand|Edit → [[Std_DuplicateSelection|Duplicate Selection]]}}. This will create {{incode|Cube004}}.

15. Select only {{incode|Cube003}} in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]], and go to {{MenuCommand|Edit → [[Std_DuplicateSelection|Duplicate Selection]]}}. This will create {{incode|Cube005}}.

16. To visualize this better we can modify the {{MenuCommand|View}} properties in the [[Property_View|Property View]].
:16.1. Select the {{incode|Cut}} object, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, click on the {{MenuCommand|Shape Appearance}} value to open the {{MenuCommand|Select Color}} dialog, then choose a blue color.
:16.2. Select all new cubes, {{incode|Cube002}}, {{incode|Cube003}}, {{incode|Cube004}}, and {{incode|Cube005}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, change the value of {{MenuCommand|Transparency}} to {{incode|80}}.

:17.3. Change the {{MenuCommand|Rotation}} to {{incode|Rotation axis with angle}}; {{MenuCommand|Axis}} to {{incode|X}}, and {{MenuCommand|Angle}} to {{incode|45 deg}}, then click on {{Button|Apply}}. This will apply a rotation around the X-axis, and will reset the {{MenuCommand|Angle}} field to zero.
:17.4. Change the {{MenuCommand|Rotation}} again, now {{MenuCommand|Axis}} to {{incode|Z}}, and {{MenuCommand|Angle}} to {{incode|45 deg}}, then click on {{Button|Apply}}. This will apply a rotation around the local Z-axis, and will reset the {{MenuCommand|Angle}} field to zero.
:17.5. Click on {{Button|OK}} to close the dialog.

18. In the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] de-select the objects; then select {{incode|Cube003}} first, the bigger cube, and then {{incode|Cube002}}, the smaller cube.
:18.1. Then press {{Button|[[File:Part_Cut.svg|16px]] [[Part_Cut|Cut]]}}. This will create {{incode|Cut001}}. This is a hollowed body which intersects the initial {{incode|Cut}} only at certain corners.

19. To visualize this better we can modify the {{MenuCommand|View}} properties in the [[Property_View|Property View]].
:19.1. Select {{incode|Cube004}} and {{incode|Cube005}}, in the {{MenuCommand|View}} tab, then change the value of {{MenuCommand|Visibility}} to {{incode|false}}, or press {{KEY|Space}} in the keyboard.
