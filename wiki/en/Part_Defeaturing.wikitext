==Description==

The [[Image:Part_Defeaturing.svg|24px]] '''Part Defeaturing''' command can remove selected form features, such as holes, protrusions, gaps, chamfers, fillets etc. from a model.

The defeaturing command can be very useful in different contexts:

* To edit an imported solid where no history of operations is available.
* Fixing defects in the model, e.g. filling gaps, holes etc.
* Model simplification for numeric analysis, display on mobile devices, etc.

The removed form features are filled by the extension of the adjacent faces, thus no unexpected parts should appear in the result. Please note that the result is a new shape that is not linked to the original; thus, it is non-parametric.

To be available, this command requires FreeCAD to be based on Open Cascade 7.3.0 or greater. If it is not available in your version of FreeCAD, you may have a look at the [[Defeaturing_Workbench|Defeaturing Workbench]] add-on, which proposes similar functionality even with older versions of OCC or FreeCAD.

==Usage==

# Select the face(s) to be removed from the model.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Defeaturing.svg|16px]] [[Part_Defeaturing|Defeaturing]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Defeaturing.svg|16px]] Defeaturing}} option from the menu.
# A '''Defeatured''' object is created and the original object hidden.
