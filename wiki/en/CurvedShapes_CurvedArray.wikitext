==Description==

Creates an array and resizes the items in the bounds of one or more hull curves. In this example, the orange base shape is rescaled in the bounds of the red and violet hullcurves. The curves do not have to be connected. The hullcurves should lie on or parallel to the XY- XZ- or YZ- plane.

==Usage==

# Select the input curves.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:CurvedShapes_workbench_icon.svg|16px]] [[CurvedShapes_CurvedArray|Curved Array]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Curved Shapes → [[Image:CurvedShapes_workbench_icon.svg|16px]] Curved Array}} option from the menu.
# In the [[Property_View|Property View]], adjust the number of items, as well as the offset end and start parameters, to create the desired shape.
# In the Property View, select the checkbox for 'Surface' or 'Solid' depending on the desired result 

==Notes==

* The first curve that you select for CurvedArray creation will be the item that is swept and resized in the bounds of the other selected curves.
* When creating a surface, be aware that CurvedArray may actually create a compound (separated at a location where the cross section curve intersects the surface generated by the tool). It will then fail to offset unless a boolean operation is used to join the surfaces together, or an explode compound operation is used to separate them to be worked with independently. 

==Properties==

{{Properties_Title|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Base}}: The object to make an array from
* {{PropertyData|Hullcurves}}: List of one or more bounding curves
* {{PropertyData|Axis}}: Direction axis of the Base shape
* {{PropertyData|Items}}: Number of array items
* {{PropertyData|OffsetStart}}: Offset of the first part in Axis direction
* {{PropertyData|OffsetEnd}}: Offset of the last part from the end in opposite Axis direction
* {{PropertyData|Twist}}: Applies a rotation around Axis to the array items
* {{PropertyData|Surface}}: Creates a surface over the array items
* {{PropertyData|Solid}}: Creates a solid if Base is a closed shape
