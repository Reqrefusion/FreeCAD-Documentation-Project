==Description==

The [[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|24px]] '''Part Thickness''' command works on a solid shape and transforms it into a hollow object, giving to each of its faces a defined and constant thickness. On some solids it allows you to significantly speed up the work, and avoids making extrusions and pockets.

==Usage== 

# Select  one or more faces of an existing solid.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|16px]] [[Part_Thickness|Thickness]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_Thickness.svg|16px]] Thickness}} option from the menu.
# A '''Thickness''' object is created and the '''Thickness''' [[Task_Panel|task panel]] opens.
#* Set the parameters (see [[#Options|Options]]).
#* Optionally press the {{Button|Faces}} button to reselect one or more faces.
# Press {{Button|OK}} to close the task panel.

==Options== 

* {{MenuCommand|Thickness}}: Wall thickness of the resulting object, set the desired value.
** A positive value will offset the faces outward
** A negative value will offset the faces inward
* {{MenuCommand|Mode}}
** {{MenuCommand|Skin}}: Only this mode is currently implemented in OCC.
** {{MenuCommand|Pipe}}: This mode has no effect as it's currently not implemented in OCC.
** {{MenuCommand|Recto verso}}: This mode has no effect as it's currently not implemented in OCC.
* {{MenuCommand|Join type}}
** {{MenuCommand|Arc}}: Removes the outer edges and creates a fillet with a radius equal to the thickness defined.
** {{MenuCommand|Tangent}}: Results in sharp corners.
** {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: Results in sharp corners.
* {{MenuCommand|Intersection}}: When enabled, self-intersections in some models are avoided.
* {{MenuCommand|Self-intersection}}: This option is currently not implemented in OCC and should be left with the default value (false).
* {{Button|Faces}}: Select the faces to be removed, then click {{Button|Done}}.
* {{MenuCommand|Update view}}: Automatically updates the view in real time.

==Notes==

* [[App_Link|App Link]] objects linked to the appropriate object types can also be used as source objects.
* Complex shapes may produce bizarre, hard to predict results. Carefully inspect the resulting shape and save your work before applying the operation.
* As noted in the [https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/class_b_rep_offset_a_p_i___make_thick_solid.html#af78f35025a31e2ce8bd96c82fb33a981 OCC documentation] and mentioned in the [[#Options|Options]] section, some options are not implemented yet.
