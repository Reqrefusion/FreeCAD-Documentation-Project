== Introduction ==

The [[Status_Bar|Status Bar]] is a ribbon that appears at the bottom of the FreeCAD [[Interface|interface]]. It can display several pieces of information and several widgets. The BIM and Draft workbenches add their own widgets to the Status Bar. It is also possible to drag a toolbar into the Status Bar.

== Information and widgets ==

=== Usage information ===

When the pointer is over a button or menu item, the usage information of that tool is displayed in the Status Bar. This information is usually the same as the tooltip of the tool.

=== Preselected information ===

When the pointer is over an object in the [[3D_View|3D View]] the Status Bar shows the preselected element of the object as well as the current 3D coordinates. This information is updated as the pointer is moved over the object. The update stops when the pointer is over an empty space in the 3D View.

The Quick Measure feature uses the right side of the Status Bar to show measurements based on the selection in 3D View.

Depending on the selection the following measurements are displayed:
* Edge length
* Face area 
* Distance between points, edges or faces
* Angle between edges
* Radius of circular edges or cylindrical faces
* {{Version|1.1}}: Diameter of circles and cylindrical faces
* {{Version|1.1}}: Axis distance between circular elements and faces, edges or other circular elements

=== Notification Area ===

TBD.

Right-clicking this area opens a context menu with the following options:
* {{MenuCommand|Delete User Notifications}}: TBD.
* {{MenuCommand|Delete All}}: TBD.

=== Navigation indicator ===

The Navigation indicator shows the current [[Mouse_navigation|Mouse navigation]] mode. Clicking the indicator opens a menu with the available modes and a {{MenuCommand|Settings}} submenu with the following options:
* {{MenuCommand|Orbit style}}: See [[Preferences_Editor#Navigation|Preferences Editor]].
* {{MenuCommand|Compact}}: If this option is checked only a mouse icon is shown in the widget.
* {{MenuCommand|Tooltip}}: If this option is checked hovering the widget will show a tooltip with detailed usage information.

=== Zoom indicator ===

The Status Bar provides information about the zoom level by showing the size of the current [[3D_View|3D View]]. Clicking the indicator opens a menu to change the unit system of the current document, or the default unit system if there is no active document.

== Context menu ==

Right-clicking the Status Bar opens a context menu with the following options:
* {{Version|1.1}}: {{MenuCommand|Input hints}}: Checkbox to toggle this feature.
* {{Version|1.1}}: {{MenuCommand|Quick measure}}: Idem.
* {{MenuCommand|Notification Area}}: Idem.
* {{MenuCommand|Navigation indicator}}: Idem.

If the pointer is over the [[#Preselected_information|Preselected information]] field or the [[#Quick_measure|Quick measure]] field the following options are added:
* {{MenuCommand|Copy}}: Copies the information selected with the next option.
* {{MenuCommand|Select All}}: Selects the current information.

The [[#Notification_Area|Notification Area]] has its own context menu.
