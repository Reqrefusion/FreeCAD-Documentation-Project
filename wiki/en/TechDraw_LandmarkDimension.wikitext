==Description==

The '''TechDraw LandmarkDimension''' tool adds a linear dimension to a View. The dimension is based on two point objects ([[Draft_Point|Draft Point]], [[Part_Point|Part Point]] or [[PartDesign_Point|PartDesign Point]] objects) from the 3D model.

The purpose of this tool is to provide a workaround to the corruption of dimensions caused by the "[[Topological_naming_problem|topological naming]]" issues. The source points should use [[Expressions|Expressions]] or other containing mechanisms to establish their position. Since the points are [[App_DocumentObject|Document Objects]], and not shape components, their name does not change with recomputes, and hence they are easily found.

See [[TechDraw_LengthDimension#Limitation|TechDraw LengthDimension]] for more on dimensions and topological naming.

==Usage==

# Select two point objects in the [[3D_view|3D view]] or [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# Add the correct TechDraw View to the selection by selecting it in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:TechDraw_LandmarkDimension.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_LandmarkDimension|Insert Landmark Dimension  - EXPERIMENTAL]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|TechDraw → Dimensions → [[Image:TechDraw_LandmarkDimension.svg|16px]] Insert Landmark Dimension  - EXPERIMENTAL}} option from the menu.
# A dimension is added to the View.
# The dimension may be dragged to the desired position.
# If needed, add tolerances as described on [[TechDraw_Geometric_dimensioning_and_tolerancing#Tolerances|this page]].

===Change properties===

To change the properties of a dimension object either double-click it in the drawing or in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. This will open the [[TechDraw_LengthDimension#Dimension_dialog|Dimension dialog]].

== Limitations ==

The Landmark Dimension tool is initially limited to "Distance" dimensions.  Other types may be added if demand warrants.

==Notes==

See [[TechDraw_LengthDimension#Notes|TechDraw LengthDimension]].

The Landmark Dimension tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following functions:

{{Code|code=
dim1 = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("TechDraw::LandmarkDimension", "Landmark")
dim1.Type = "Distance"
dim1.References2D = [(TDView, "Vertex1")]
dim1.References3D = [(Point3d1, "Vertex1")]
dim1.References3D = [(Point3d2, "Vertex1")]
page.addView(dim1)
}}
