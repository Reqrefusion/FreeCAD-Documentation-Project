{{VeryImportantMessage|THIS COMMAND IS PART OF THE INTEGRATED [[BIM_Workbench|BIM WORKBENCH]] IN V1.0<br>

== Description == 

The '''Arch Pipe''' tool allows to create pipes from scratch, or from selected objects. The selected objects must contain a single open wire.

==Usage==

# Optionally, select a linear [[Part_Workbench|Part]] shape such as a [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]], a [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] or an open [[Sketcher_NewSketch|Sketch]].
# Invoke this command using several methods:
#* Pressing the {{Button|[[Image:Arch_Pipe.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Pipe|Pipe]]}} button on the toolbar.
#* Pressing the {{KEY|P}} then {{KEY|I}} keyboard shortcut.
#* Pressing the {{MenuCommand|3D/BIM → Pipe}} entry from the top menu.

== Options ==


== Properties ==

An Arch Pipe object shares the common properties and behaviors of all [[Arch_Component|Arch Components]].

===Data===

{{TitleProperty|Component}}

* {{PropertyData|Base|Link}}: The base wire of this pipe, if any.

For the other properties in the group see [[Arch_Component#Properties|Arch Component]].

{{TitleProperty|Pipe}}

* {{PropertyData|Diameter|Length}}: The diameter of this pipe, if its {{PropertyData|Profile Type}} is {{Value|Circle}}.
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: The height of this pipe, if its {{PropertyData|Profile Type}} is {{Value|Rectangle}}.
* {{PropertyData|Length|Length}}: The length of this pipe, if not based on a wire.
* {{PropertyData|Offset End|Length}}: The offset from the end point of the pipe. Automatically set if an [[Arch_PipeConnector|Arch PipeConnector]] is added at this point to make the pipe fit the connector. See [[#Typical workflow|Typical workflow]] below.
* {{PropertyData|Offset Start|Length}}: The offset from the start point of the pipe. Idem.
* {{PropertyData|Profile|Link}}: The base profile of this pipe. If not set, the pipe profile is determined by {{PropertyData|Profile Type}}.
* {{PropertyData|Profile Type|Enumeration}}: The profile of this pipe. Only used if {{PropertyData|Profile}} is not set. The options are: {{Value|Circle}}, {{Value|Square}} or {{Value|Rectangle}}.
* {{PropertyData|Wall Thickness|Length}}: The wall thickness of this pipe.
* {{PropertyData|Width|Length}}: The width of this pipe, if its {{PropertyData|Profile Type}} is {{Value|Square}} or {{Value|Rectangle}}.

== Typical workflow ==

* Start by placing sanitary/hydraulic appliance items (below is an imported step file). You turn these objects into Arch Equipments by selecting them, and pressing the [[Arch_Equipment|Arch Equipment]] button.

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_01.jpg]]

* Arch Equipments now have a new '''SnapPoints''' property, which is a list of 3D vectors. This allows you to add custom snap points, to which you can snap when the new [[Draft_Snap_Special|Draft Special]] snap button is turned on. Currently that property is only available to Python, though. In the case above I added a new snap point at the exit of the WC appliance. The vectors inside SnapPoints appear on the model as white dots:

 FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.Equipment.SnapPoints=[FreeCAD.Vector(0,0,100)]

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_02.jpg]]

* With the new [[Draft_Snap_Special|"Snap Special"]] Draft Snap, you can now snap to these custom points:

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_03.jpg]]

* Now we can draw our piping using Draft Lines, Draft Wires, or Sketches. The best way, though, is using only Draft Lines:

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_04.jpg]]

* The [[Draft_Slope|Draft Slope]] tool allows to change the slope of Draft lines, to, for example, 5% (0.05). So we can quickly give our waste lines a correct slope. Only z coordinates are change by this tool, so we only need to snap them back to each other, the top projection will stay unchanged.

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_05.jpg]]

* We now only have to select all our lines, and press the [[Arch_Pipe|Arch Pipe]] button. Arch Pipe works with any Part-based object that contains one and only one open wire.

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_06.jpg]]

* We can now create connections by selecting 2 or 3 coincident tubes, and press the [[Arch_PipeConnector|Arch PipeConnector]] button. If 3 pipes are selected, two of them must be aligned in order to create a tee element:

[[Image:Arch_pipe_example_07.jpg]]

* Changing the connectors radius doesn't change the length of the underlying base line, only the resulting tube (by changing their OffsetStart or OffsetEnd property). So you can still draw your line layout with only straight lines, without the need to care about curves and radius.

It is also possible to create Arch Pipes without a base line, in this case use its "Length" property to define the length.

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch_API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Pipe tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=
pipe = makePipe(baseobj=None, diameter=0, length=0, placement=None, name="Pipe")
}}

* Creates a {{incode|pipe}} object from the given {{incode|baseobj}} and {{incode|diameter}}.
** {{incode|baseobj}} is a [[Draft_Line|Draft Line]] or [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]].
** If {{incode|baseobj}} is omitted, a straight pipe can be created with just the {{incode|diameter}} and the {{incode|length}} in the Z direction.
* If a {{incode|placement}} is given, it is used.

{{Code|code=
import Draft, Arch

p1 = FreeCAD.Vector(1000, 0, 0)
p2 = FreeCAD.Vector(2500, 200, 0)
p3 = FreeCAD.Vector(3100, 1000, 0)
p4 = FreeCAD.Vector(3500, 500, 0)
line = Draft.make_wire([p1, p2, p3, p4])

pipe = Arch.makePipe(line, 200)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

pipe2 = Arch.makePipe(diameter=120, length=3000)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()
}}
