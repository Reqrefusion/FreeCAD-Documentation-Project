==Description== 

{{Button|[[File:Surface_GeomFillSurface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|Surface GeomFillSurface]]}} creates a parametric surface from two, three, or four boundary edges, trying to create a smooth transition between them.

{{Caption|Left: edges that are used to generate a surface with the [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|GeomFillSurface]] tool, 4 connected edges, 3 connected edges, and 2 disconnected edges. Right: resulting surface from using the 4, 3, and 2 edges, respectively.}}

==Usage==

# Press the {{Button|[[File:Surface_GeomFillSurface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|Fill boundary curves]]}} button.
# Select edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. The edges must connect together so that they formed a closed profile.
# Press {{Button|OK}}.

{{Emphasis|Note:}} once created, it is not possible to apply additional constraints to the created surface.

==Options==

{{MenuCommand|Fill type}}: {{RadioButton|TRUE|Stretch}}, {{RadioButton|TRUE|Coons}}, or {{RadioButton|TRUE|Curved}}.

==Properties==

A [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|Surface GeomFillSurface]] ({{incode|Surface::GeomFillSurface}} class) is derived from the basic [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class, through the {{incode|Part::Spline}} subclass), therefore it shares all the latter's properties.

In addition to the properties described in [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]], the Surface Filling has the following properties in the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

*{{PropertyData|Fill Type|Enumeration}}: the applied filling algorithm; Stretch, the style with the flattest patches; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coons_patch {{Value|Coons}}], a rounded style with less depth than Curved; Curved, the style with the most rounded patches.
*{{PropertyData|Boundary List|LinkSubList}}: a list of edges that will be used to build the surface.
*{{PropertyData|Reversed List|BoolList|(hidden)}}:

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Control Points|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}; if set to {{TRUE}}, it will show an overlay with the control points of the surface.

== Twisting of the surface ==

The shape of the surface depends on the direction of the chosen edges; if edges are selected and the result is a surface that "twists" on itself, one of the edges may need its list of vertices in the reverse order. A surface that twists on itself will probably have self-intersections, and thus will be an invalid [[Part_TopoShape|Shape]]; this can be verified with {{Button|[[File:Part_CheckGeometry.svg|16px]] [[Part_CheckGeometry|Part CheckGeometry]]}}.

For example, if two curves have the points
{{Code|code=
curve1 = [a, b, c, d]
curve2 = [e, f, g]
}}
and the resulting surface after using {{Button|[[File:Surface_GeomFillSurface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|GeomFillSurface]]}} or {{Button|[[File:Surface_Sections.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Sections|Sections]]}} is a twisted surface, you may create a third curve that is equal to one of the two original curves but with a reversed list of points.

Either
{{Code|code=
curve1 = [a, b, c, d]
curve3 = [g, f, e]
}}

or
{{Code|code=
curve3 = [d, c, b, a]
curve2 = [e, f, g]
}}
should work to generate a surface that doesn't twist.

In practical terms this means that all edges used to generate a surface should be created preferably in the same clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Following this simple rule usually guarantees that the surface will follow the smoothest direction and won't twist.

When the surface's {{PropertyView|Lighting}} property is {{Value|One side}}, a face will be painted completely black if its normal direction points into the [[3D_view|3D view]] (away from the current viewer), indicating a flipped face with respect to the other colored faces.

{{Caption|Left: the boundary edges are oriented in the same direction, and thus the generated surface is smooth. Right: the boundary edges have opposite directions, and thus the generated surface twists on itself, resulting in self-intersections.}}

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Surface GeomFillSurface tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by adding the {{incode|Surface::GeomFillSurface}} object.
* The edges to be used to define the surface must be assigned as a [[FeaturePython_Custom_Properties#App::PropertyLinkSubList|LinkSubList]] to the {{incode|BoundaryList}} property of the object.
* The type of algorithm must be assigned like a string to the {{incode|FillType}} property.
* All objects with edges need to be computed before they can be used as input for the properties of the GeomFillSurface object.
