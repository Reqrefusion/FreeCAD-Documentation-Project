{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Std_Transform_Manip_relnotes_1.1.gif|384px]]</br>Click on the image if the animation does not start.
| The [[Image:Std_TransformManip.svg|24px]] [[Std TransformManip|Transform]] tool was overhauled and now allows for precise inputs besides dragging in the 3D view. It is possible to align the interactive dragger to any element in the document and to transform the object in that local (U, V, W) coordinate system of the dragger, or in the global document coordinate system. The dragger can be aligned to the object's origin as before, and also to the center of mass of the object. It has a new feature to move the object (at the location of the dragger) to a target location in the document and flip the orientation. See all [[Std_TransformManip#Options|new options]].
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17564 Pull request #17564]

=== Further Draft improvements ===

* The [[Draft_Fillet|Draft Fillet]] command now works on selected edges, instead of the first edge of selected objects. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17945 Pull request #17945] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18150 Pull request #18150]
* The [[Draft_AutoGroup|Draft AutoGroup]] and the [[Draft_AddToGroup|Draft AddToGroup]] commands have been improved. The menus of both commands are sorted alphabetically. In the menu of the [[Draft_AutoGroup|Draft AutoGroup]] command layers are separated from groups, and the ''New layer'' option prompts for a name and activates the layer. The actions of both commands have been made undoable. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18172 Pull request #18172] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19312 Pull request #19312]
* The position of the ''Scale multiplier'' field in the UI was improved ([[Draft_SetStyle|Draft SetStyle]], [[Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor|Draft AnnotationStyleEditor]] and [[Draft_Preferences|Draft Preferences]]). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18299 Pull request #18299]

* The texts of newly created dimensions are now oriented automatically relative to the current working plane. A [[Fine-tuning#Draft_Workbench|fine-tuning]] parameter is available to disable this behavior. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20072 Pull request #20072]
* [[Draft_Snap_Near|Near snap]] no longer overrides other snaps. On-object snaps, such as [[Draft_Snap_Midpoint|Midpoint snap]] and [[Draft_Snap_Endpoint|Endpoint snap]], within ''snapRange'' of the cursor are now detected. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20118 Pull request #20118]
* In the [[Draft_Preferences#Texts_and_dimensions|Draft Preferences]] a dropdown to select the font name for texts, dimensions and labels has been introduced. Previously the name had to be entered manually. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20400 Pull request #20400]
* The ''Continue'' option is now stored separately for each Draft and BIM command. For the [[Draft_Dimension|Draft Dimension]] command the old ''Continue'' option has been re-labeled to ''Chained mode'' for clarity, and a new ''Continue'' option has been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20748 Pull request #20748]
* The [[Draft_ShapeString|Draft ShapeString]] command has seen several improvements. The font file is no longer a preference, instead the last selected file is stored. For the initial value of the font file an attempt is made to get a suitable file from the OS. This is primarily to help users who are not aware of font file locations. The last entered text and height are also stored. A ''Global'' option has been added to task panel.

* A [[FEM_Preferences#CalculiX|CalculiX-related preference]] named ''Result object'' was added. If its checkbox ''Pipeline only'' is enabled, a newly refactored CalculiX solver object is added to the Analysis container when using the ''Solver CalculiX'' option. It has an updated task panel, doesn't generate [[Image:FEM_ResultShow.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ResultShow|CCX_Results objects]] (only the [[Image:FEM_PostPipelineFromResult.svg|24px]] [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|results pipeline object]] is created) and will be further developed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20609 Pull request #20609]

[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23277 Pull request #23277] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23530 Pull request #23530]
* [[Image:FEM_MeshNetgenFromShape.svg|24px]] [[FEM_MeshNetgenFromShape|Netgen]] can now be installed in the standard way mentioned on [https://ngsolve.org/downloads/ its download page] and it is only necessary to point FreeCAD to the proper Python executable in the preferences (by default the Python executable specified in general Python preferences is used). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23613 Pull request #23613]
* Some preferences related to mesh export now have better defaults. Namely, groups of nodes are enabled for the Gmsh mesher and export to INP files includes FEM elements only and groups by default. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23553 Pull request #23553]
* Properties of the [[Image:FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools.svg|24px]] [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver]] are now grouped and time incrementation properties are more user-friendly (improved names, better defaults, easy switch between automatic and direct incrementation as well as no need to enable additional property to set non-default incrementation). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23494 Pull request #23494]
* There is a new ''Pastix Mixed Precision'' property of the [[Image:FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools.svg|24px]] [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver]].

=== Further Part Design improvements ===

* The origin feature in a Part Design body makes use of the new core datums. The appearance has been changed and the planes enlarge when creating a new sketch. As the orientation was wrong in older FreeCAD versions, files created with these versions need to be converted on opening. It can break files which reference the datums, and converted or new files created with {{VersionPlus|1.1}} will be broken in {{VersionMinus|1.0}}. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18126 Pull request #18126]

* The initial angle for tapered threads in the [[Image:PartDesign_Hole.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Hole|Hole tool]] is now automatically set to the value from the ISO 7-1 and ASME B1.20.1 standards. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15744 Pull request #15744]
* The [[Image:PartDesign_Hole.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Hole|Hole tool]] can now create holes based on sketch points and arcs in addition to circles. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20583 Pull request #20583]
* ''SwitchToTask'', formerly a  [[Fine-tuning|fine-tuning]] parameter, can now be accessed from the [[PartDesign_Preferences#General|Preferences Editor]]. It can be used to enable and disable automatic switching to the task panel when the Part Design Workbench is activated. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22136 Pull request #22136]
* The [[Image:PartDesign_Pad.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad]] task panel was improved to have more options for ''Two sided'' mode. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21794 Pull request #21794]

|}

=== Further Sketcher improvements ===

* It is now possible to directly use external geometry as input for tools like offset or transform (array), for both external construction and defining geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17615 Pull request #17615]
* External geometry (projected or intersecting) is now by default real (defining) geometry (which does not need to be traced as in 1.0 and prior). It can be toggled to construction geometry as any other geometry [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17736 Pull request #17736]
* The Sketcher axes are now displayed with infinite length. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17312 Pull request #17312]
* Sketches are now ordered alphabetically in the [[Image:Sketcher_MapSketch.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_MapSketch|Attach sketch]] dialog. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16518 Pull request #16518]
* Group dragging was added, making it possible to drag all the selected geometrical entities. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18273 Pull request #18273]

* Status bar hints were added for Sketcher geometry creation, constraint, edit and transform tools. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21632 Pull request #21632],  [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21751 Pull request #21751], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21806 Pull request #21806] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21840 Pull request #21840]
* Sketches are now automatically scaled after entering the first dimension to avoid breaking the shape when the first dimension is much larger/smaller than the current size of the geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21084 Pull request #21084]
* When creating geometry the mouse movement is ignored if a value is entered in the [[Sketcher_Workbench#On-View-Parameters|on-view-parameters]] (OVP). Tab cycles between OVP input boxes and Enter now confirms. Deleting the value of an OVP input box enables mouse movement for the dimension again. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/20925 Pull request #20925]
* Rendering of geometry lines is now prioritized over constraints so that dimensions lines don't cover the geometry. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21982 Pull request #21982]
* Now all parts of dimension constraints can be selected, not only labels. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21920 Pull request #21920]
* It is now possible to use the Ctrl+A shortcut (or Select All option in the Edit menu) to select all geometries within the sketch. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23289 Pull request #23289]
* Box selection from left to right now uses another color than from right to left to indicate different behavior. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23261 Pull request #23261]
* There is a new preference for constraint symbol size. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23366 Pull request #23366]

[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15556 Pull request #15556]
* Double-clicking on the separator in the header now resizes the column to content. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16296 Pull request #16296]
* Zoom was added to Spreadsheet. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16130 Pull request #16130]
* Icons were added to context menu entries. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22773 Pull request #22773]

== Surface Workbench ==

* A task panel was added for the [[Image:Surface_BlendCurve.svg|24px]] [[Surface_BlendCurve|Blend Curve]] tool. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21825 Pull request #21825]

== TechDraw Workbench ==

* The [[Image:TechDraw_AreaDimension.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_AreaDimension|Insert Area Annotation]] tool now properly accounts for holes in faces. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/17740 Pull request #17740]
* Shape validation is now available and can be enabled in [[TechDraw_Preferences#Advanced|Preferences]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18282 Pull request #18282]
* Scaling of SVG symbols has been fixed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/18757 Pull request #18757]
* New ''r'' format specifier was added. It rounds the dimension value to the step specified as decimal before ''r''. For example, ''%0.5r'' (or just ''%.5r'') rounds to 0.5. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19393 Pull request #19393]
* Snapping of detail view highlights to the closest vertex in the TaskDialog drag highlight process was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22036 Pull request #22036]
* Instead of [[TechDraw_ToggleFrame|toggling view frames]], they are now shown and hidden automatically when hovering the cursor over the view. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22869 Pull request #22869]
* The cosmetic circle commands were renamed and grouped for clarity. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/22945 Pull request #22945]
* The deprecated [[Image:TechDraw_LandmarkDimension.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_LandmarkDimension|LandmarkDimension]] and [[Image:TechDraw_LinkDimension.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_LinkDimension|LinkDimension]] tools were removed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/21483 Pull request #21483]
* Number of decimals and reference dimension options were added to the [[Image:TechDraw_Dimension.svg|24px]] [[TechDraw_Dimension|dimension]] task panel. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/23501 Pull request #23501]
