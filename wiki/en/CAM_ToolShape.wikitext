== Description ==

ToolShapes are a core part of the [[CAM_Tools|CAM Tools]] system. ToolShapes are the templates from which ToolBits are created. They represent the specific physical shape of a tool. A ToolShape does not completely describe the bit - for that some additional parameters are needed which will be added when an actual bit is parameterized from the template.

Initially ToolShapes are just FreeCAD documents with a single Body created from the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px|link=PartDesign_Workbench]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|Part Design ]] workbench. 

Creating new ToolShapes is an advanced topic. The most commonly needed ToolShapes already exist and are provided with the FreeCAD installation at:

* On Linux it is usually {{incode|/usr/lib64/FreeCAD/Mod/CAM/Tools/Shape}}
* On Windows it is usually {{incode|C:\Program Files\FreeCAD\Mod\CAM\Tools\Shape}}
* On macOS it is usually {{incode|/Applications/FreeCAD.app/Contents/Resources/Mod/CAM/Tools/Shape}}

They are:
: {{FileName|ballend.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|bullnose.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|chamfer.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|drill.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|endmill.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|probe.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|slittingsaw.fcstd}}
: {{FileName|thread-mill.fcstd}}  
: {{FileName|v-bit.fcstd}}
      
These can be found in the {{FileName|Mod/CAM/Tools/Shape/}} subdirectory where FreeCAD was installed.

== Usage ==

# Create a new FreeCAD document.
# Open the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]].
# Create a [[PartDesign_Body|Body]] and give the Body a label you want to show up in the bit selection.
# Create a [[Image:PartDesign_NewSketch.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_NewSketch|Sketch]] on the XZ plane and draw half the profile of the bit.
# Constrain the bottom most center of the bit on the origin {{incode|(0,0)}}. This will be the center of the axis on which the G-code will rotate the bit.
#* Note: Do not add dimensional constraints at this time.
# Close the Sketch.
# [[Image:PartDesign_Revolution.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Revolution|Revolve]] the Sketch around the vertical Sketch axis.
# Open the [[Image:Workbench_CAM.svg|16px]] [[CAM_Workbench|CAM Workbench]].
# Select the Sketch in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. This ensures that the PropertyBag created in the next step will be nested in the Body.
# Select the {{MenuCommand|CAM → Utils → PropertyBag}} option from the menu.
# A PropertyBag named {{Value|Attributes}} is created. This PropertyBag will be used to control the dimensions in the Sketch.
# Double-click the PropertyBag in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# The {{MenuCommand|Property Bag}} task panel opens.
# Click the {{Button|Add...}} button.
# The {{MenuCommand|Create Property}} dialog opens.
# Create a property named {{Value|Diameter}}. This property is mandatory for ToolBits. Property names are case-sensitive and may not contain spaces.
# Select {{Value|Shape}} from the {{MenuCommand|Group}} dropdown list.
# Select the appropriate {{MenuCommand|Type}}.
# Optionally specify a {{MenuCommand|ToolTip}}.
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button.
# In the {{MenuCommand|Property Bag}} task panel enter a value for the '''Diameter''' property.
# Similarly add all other required properties.
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button in the {{MenuCommand|Property Bag}} task panel when done.
# Double-click the Sketch in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# Add dimensional constraints and apply the properties from the created PropertyBag. For example to apply the '''Diameter''' property:
## Double-click a dimension.
## Click the [[Image:Bound-expression.svg|16px]] icon.
## Enter {{Value|<<Attributes>>.Diameter}} in the {{MenuCommand|Formula editor}}.
## Click the {{Button|OK}} button twice.
# Repeat this until the Sketch is  fully constrained.
# Save the {{FileName|FCStd}} file where FreeCAD expects to find ToolBit files. See [[#Description|Description]] above.

* Note 1. If you are denied access to the folder on Windows, start FreeCAD in ADMINISTRATOR mode.
* Note 2. The Body of the ToolBit must be the first object in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. These instructions ensure that this is the case.

== Tool Thumbnail Images ==

ToolBits will have a small icon image of the tool in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] if the file is saved with thumbnails active.

Important notes:
* Before saving the document make sure you have Save Thumbnail selected, and Add program logo deselected in FreeCAD's preferences.
* Also make sure to switch to Front View and Fit content to screen
* Whatever you see when saving the document will end up being the visual representation of the template
