==Description== 

A [[Image:Part_RegularPolygon.svg|24px]] '''Part RegularPolygon''' is a parametric shape that can be created with the [[Image:Part_Primitives.svg|24px]] [[Part_Primitives|Part Primitives]] command. In the coordinate system defined by its {{PropertyData|Placement}} property, the polygon lies on the XY-plane with its center at the origin and one of its vertices on the X-axis.

==Usage==

See [[Part_Primitives#Usage|Part Primitives]].

== Example ==

[[Image:Part_RegularPolygon_Scripting_Example.png|thumb|Part RegularPolygon from the scripting example]]

A Part RegularPolygon object created with the [[#Scripting|scripting example]] below is shown here.

== Properties ==

See also: [[Property_View|Property View]].

A Part RegularPolygon object is derived from a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [[Part_Part2DObject#Data|Part Part2DObject]].

{{TitleProperty|Regular Polygon}}

* {{PropertyData|Polygon|IntegerConstraint}}: The number of sides of the polygon. The default is {{Value|6}}.
* {{PropertyData|Circumradius|Length}}: The radius of the circle that circumscribes the polygon, the distance from the center of the polygon to one of its vertices. The default is {{Value|2mm}}.

== Scripting ==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation], [[Part_scripting|Part scripting]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

A Part RegularPolygon can be created with the {{Incode|addObject()}} method of the document:

{{Code|code=
poly = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::RegularPolygon", "myPolygon")
}}

* Where {{Incode|"myPolygon"}} is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

poly = doc.addObject("Part::RegularPolygon", "myPolygon")
poly.Polygon = 5
poly.Circumradius = 8
poly.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(60, 30, 15))

doc.recompute()
}}
