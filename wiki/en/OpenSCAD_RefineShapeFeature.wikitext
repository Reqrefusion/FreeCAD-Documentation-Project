==Description== 

Cleans unnecessary lines. After a Boolean operation, some lines defining the previous form remain visible, this tool creates a copy of the totally cleaned.

[[File:PartRefineShape_it.png]]

==Usage== 

# Select the shape to be cleaned.
# Select the {{MenuCommand|OpenSCAD → [[Image:OpenSCAD_RefineShapeFeature.svg|24px]] Refine shape}} option from the menu.
# A parent-object is created and totally cleaned, the original object is rendered hidden.

==Limitations== 

* The refinement algorithm only works on shells. Therefore it iterates over the shells of the input shape and then for each shell it creates a new shell with joined faces wherever possible. This means if your input shape is only a face, wire, edge or vertex then the algorithm does nothing.
* As opposed to [[Image:Part_RefineShape.svg|24px]] [[Part_RefineShape|Part RefineShape]] in the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px|link=Part Workbench]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]], this feature '''WILL''' update when the underlying shapes are changed.

==Notes== 

* the function does not modify the existing shape, but returns a new shape.
* the function is normally used as last step in the modelling history.
* the function can help to get difficult fillets to work.
* the function is intended to stop 3D printers from printing unwanted edges.
