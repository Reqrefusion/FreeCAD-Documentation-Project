==Description== 

Cleans unnecessary lines. After a Boolean operation, some lines defining the previous form remain visible, this tool creates a copy of the totally cleaned.

[[File:PartRefineShape_it.png]]

==Usage== 

# Select the shape to be cleaned.
# Select the {{MenuCommand|OpenSCAD → [[Image:OpenSCAD_RefineShapeFeature.svg|24px]] Refine Shape Feature}} option from the menu.
# A parent-object is created and totally cleaned, the original object is rendered hidden.

==Limitations== 

* The refinement algorithm only works on shells. Therefore it iterates over the shells of the input shape and then for each shell it creates a new shell with joined faces wherever possible. This means if your input shape is only a face, wire, edge or vertex then the algorithm does nothing.

==Notes== 

* The function does not modify the existing shape, but returns a new shape.
* The function is normally used as last step in the modelling history.
* The function can help to get difficult fillets to work.
* The function is intended to stop 3D printers from printing unwanted edges.
