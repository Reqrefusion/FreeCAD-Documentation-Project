==Description==

{{Button|[[File:Surface_CurveOnMesh.svg|16px]] [[Surface_CurveOnMesh|Surface CurveOnMesh]]}} creates approximated spline segments on top of a selected [[Mesh_Workbench|mesh]].

If the object is not a [[Mesh|Mesh]], but a parametric [[Shape|Shape]] or surface, it must be converted first to a mesh using {{Button|[[File:Mesh_FromPartShape.svg|16px]] [[Mesh_FromPartShape|Mesh FromPartShape]]}}.

These edges created on top of the mesh may be further used to re-create the surface in a parametric way by using tools such as {{Button|[[File:Surface_GeomFillSurface.svg|16px]] [[Surface_GeomFillSurface|GeomFillSurface]]}} and {{Button|[[File:Surface_Sections.svg|16px]] [[Surface_Sections|Sections]]}}.

==Usage==

# Make sure you have a [[Mesh|mesh object]]. This can be created by the [[File:Workbench_Mesh.svg|24px]] [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]], or by importing a mesh file type, like STL, [[Arch_OBJ|OBJ]], or [[Arch_DAE|DAE]]. If a solid object or solid file type (STEP) is used, it can be converted to a mesh using {{Button|[[File:Mesh_FromPartShape.svg|16px]] [[Mesh_FromPartShape|Mesh FromPartShape]]}}.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Surface_CurveOnMesh.svg|16px]] [[Surface_CurveOnMesh|Curve on Mesh...]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Surface → [[Image:Surface_CurveOnMesh.svg|16px]] Curve on Mesh...}} option from the menu.
# Press {{Button|Start}}.
# Using the mouse pointer, pick points on the surface of the mesh in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; pick as many points as necessary to draw a smooth preview line.
# When enough points have been added, right click on the [[3D_view|3D view]] to open the context menu, and select {{MenuCommand|Create}}. Depending on how smooth the original mesh is, one spline or multiple splines will be created in the [[tree_view|tree view]].
# Repeat the sequence {{Button|Start}} → Pick → {{MenuCommand|Create}}, to add more approximated splines.
# The new spline will be created, and will appear in the [[Tree_view|tree view]], immediately after choosing {{MenuCommand|Create}}; the [[Task_panel|task panel]] will remain active.
# Press {{Button|Close}} to close the [[Task_panel|task panel]], and terminate the command completely.

After pressing {{Button|Start}}, the context menu (right-click) in the [[3D_view|3D view]] shows various options beside {{MenuCommand|Create}}.
* {{MenuCommand|Close wire}}: if at least three points have been picked, this option will be available to join the last point to the first point with a line.
* {{MenuCommand|Clear}}: it will erase the tentative points that have been picked on the mesh, and will allow you to pick new ones.
* {{MenuCommand|Cancel}}: it will erase the tentative points that have been picked, and will stop the picking operation. Press {{Button|Start}} again to pick points once more.

==Options==

{{Emphasis|(Editor: this information must be verified)}}

{{MenuCommand|Wire}} section:
* {{MenuCommand|Snap tolerances to vertices}}: it defaults to {{Value|10 px}}; it indicates the minimum distance between one point and another when picking with the pointer.
* {{MenuCommand|Split threshold}}: it defaults to {{Value|45 deg}}; it indicates the angular deviation from one point in the mesh to another point necessary to create a new spline instead of extending the previous spline.

{{MenuCommand|Spline approximation}}, if it is {{CheckBox|TRUE|checked}}, it will create spline objects, otherwise, it will create simple straight line objects (polyline).
* {{MenuCommand|Tolerance to mesh}}: it defaults to {{Value|0.2}}. It is a parameter that takes into account the imperfections of the mesh; the smaller this number the more precise it will consider the mesh, particularly if it is a very fine mesh.
* {{MenuCommand|Continuity}}: it defaults to {{Value|C2}}. It determines the continuity of the spline; it can be {{Value|C0}} (touching), {{Value|C1}} (tangent), {{Value|C2}} (curvature), and {{Value|C3}} (acceleration curvature).
* {{MenuCommand|Maximum curve degree}}: it defaults to {{Value|5}}. It determines the maximum degree of the spline to approximate the surface; it can be a value from {{Value|1}} to {{Value|8}}.

==Properties==

If {{CheckBox|FALSE|Spline approximation}} is unchecked, the [[Surface_CurveOnMesh|Curve on mesh]] tool creates a basic [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]].

If {{CheckBox|TRUE|Spline approximation}} is checked, the [[Surface_CurveOnMesh|Curve on mesh]] tool creates a {{Button|[[File:Part_Spline.svg|16px]] [[Part_Spline|Part Spline]]}} ({{incode|Part::Spline}} class) which is derived from the basic [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] ({{incode|Part::Feature}} class), therefore it shares all the latter's properties.

In addition to the properties described in [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]], the Part Spline has the following properties in the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Control Points|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}; if set to {{TRUE}}, it will show an overlay with the control points of the surface.
