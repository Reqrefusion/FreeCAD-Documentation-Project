== Introduction ==

[[File:Mesh_Tree.svg|32px]]

A [[Mesh Feature|Mesh Feature]] object, or formally a {{incode|Mesh::Feature}}, is a simple element with an associated [[Mesh_MeshObject|mesh object]] that can be displayed in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

A Mesh Feature is similar conceptually to a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]]; the former is the base object for elements with "mesh" information, while the latter is the base object for elements with "geometrical shape" information.

Please note that the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]] also uses meshes, but it uses a different object, called [[FEM_Mesh|FEM FemMeshObject]] ({{incode|Fem::FemMeshObject}} class). This object is not derived from the Mesh Feature and has different properties.

== Usage ==

Almost all mesh objects created by the commands available in the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] are [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Features]]. The parametric mesh objects created by the [[Mesh_BuildRegularSolid|Mesh BuildRegularSolid]] command are the only exception. A [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] can also be created from the [[Python_console|Python console]] as described in the [[#Scripting|Scripting]] section.

The {{incode|Mesh::Feature}} is defined in the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] but can be used as the base class for [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]] in all [[Workbenches|workbenches]] that produce 2D and 3D meshes.

A {{incode|Mesh::Feature}} has simple properties like a [[Placement|placement]], and visual properties to define the appearance of its edges and faces.

== Properties ==

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] ({{incode|Mesh::Feature}} class) is derived from the basic [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] ({{incode|App::GeoFeature}} class) and inherits all its properties. It also has several additional properties. Notably a {{PropertyData|Mesh}} property, which stores its [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]]. This is the geometry that is shown in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

These are the properties available in the [[Property_View|Property View]]. Hidden properties can be shown by using the {{MenuCommand|Show hidden}} command in the context menu of the [[Property_View|Property View]].

See [[Part_Feature#Properties|Part Feature]] for an explanation of some of the properties listed below.

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Proxy|PythonObject|Hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Mesh|MeshKernel}}: the [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]] associated with this object.
* {{PropertyData|Placement|Placement}}
* {{PropertyData|_ Element Map Version|String|Hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Label|String}}
* {{PropertyData|Label2|String|Hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Expression Engine|ExpressionEngine|Hidden}}
* {{PropertyData|Visibility|Bool|Hidden}}

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Proxy|PythonObject|Hidden}}
* {{PropertyView|Transform Origin|Placement|Hidden}}

{{TitleProperty|Display Options}}

* {{PropertyView|Bounding Box|Bool}}
* {{PropertyView|Display Mode|Enumeration}}
* {{PropertyView|Show In Tree|Bool}}
* {{PropertyView|Visibility|Bool}}

{{TitleProperty|Object Style}}

* {{PropertyView|Coloring|Bool|Hidden}}: TBD.
* {{PropertyView|Crease Angle|FloatConstraint}}: TBD.
* {{PropertyView|Lighting|Enumeration}}
* {{PropertyView|Line Color|Color}}
* {{PropertyView|Line Transparency|Percent}}: an integer from {{value|0}} to {{value|100}} that determines the level of transparency of the edges. A value of {{value|100}} indicates completely invisible edges; the edges are invisible but they can still be picked as long as {{PropertyView|Selectable}} is {{TRUE}}.
* {{PropertyView|Line Width|FloatConstraint}}
* {{PropertyView|Open Edges|Bool}}: TBD.
* {{PropertyView|Point Size|FloatConstraint}}
* {{PropertyView|Shape Appearance|MaterialList}}
* {{PropertyView|Transparency|Percent}}

{{TitleProperty|Selection}}

* {{PropertyView|On Top When Selected|Enumeration}}
* {{PropertyView|Selectable|Bool}}
* {{PropertyView|Selection Style|Enumeration}}

== Scripting ==

See also: [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]] and [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]].

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects to the document.

A Mesh Feature is created with the {{incode|addObject()}} method of the document.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Mesh::Feature", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}

For [[Python|Python]] subclassing you should create the {{incode|Mesh::FeaturePython}} object.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Mesh::FeaturePython", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}
