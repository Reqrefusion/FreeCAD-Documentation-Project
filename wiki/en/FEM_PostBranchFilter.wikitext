{{GuiCommand

==Description==

Branches the pipeline, allowing to have two separated branches where the data propagates through. This allows the creation of complex data processing pipelines that make it possible to overlay many filter setups to create intricate visualizations. This might be particularly useful for electromagnetic simulations, where you may want to overlay glyphs with cuts, possibly in different orientations, with different fields shown, etc.

==Usage==

# Select a previously created [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipeline]] or filter.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_PostBranchFilter.svg|16px]] [[FEM_PostBranchFilter|Pipeline Branch]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Results → [[Image:FEM_PostBranchFilter.svg|16px]] Pipeline Branch}} option from the menu.
# Select the ''Mode'':
#* '''Serial''' - branch input data is propagated to the first child, then its output goes to the second and so on.
#* '''Parallel''' - branch input data is propagated to all children filters, so that each gets the same data.
# Select the ''Output'':
#* '''Passthrough''' - branch input data gets passed through to output.
#* '''Append''' - all branch children filters outputs are appended and form the branch output.
# Adjust the {{MenuCommand|Result display options}} like for the [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipeline]].
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button to finish the command.

==Notes==

* If a branch or any of its children is selected, a newly created filter is added to the branch as the latest child. If the parent pipeline or a neighbor filter is selected, the new filter is added to the pipeline itself.
