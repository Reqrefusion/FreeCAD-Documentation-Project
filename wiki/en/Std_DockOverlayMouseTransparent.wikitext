==Description==

The '''Std DockOverlayMouseTransparent''' command toggles a global "click-through" mode for all panels currently in the [[Std_DockOverlayAll|overlay system]].

When this mode is activated, '''all overlay panels become completely non-interactive to mouse input'''. All mouse actions —clicks, drags, scrolls, etc.— will pass directly through the panels to the [[3D_View|3D View]] or whichever widget is underneath them. The panels effectively become a visual-only layer.

The mouse cursor will also change to indicate that this special mode is active.

This mode is designed for situations where a user needs to keep panels visible for reference but wants to perform a series of uninterrupted mouse operations in the 3D View without the risk of accidentally hovering over a panel and making it opaque.

To exit this mode and make the overlay panels interactive again, the command must be invoked again or the {{KEY|Esc}} key must be pressed.

==Usage==

# The [[Std_DockOverlayAll|overlay mode]] must be active.
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|View → Overlay Docked Panel → Bypass Mouse Events in Overlay Panels}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|T}} then {{KEY|T}}.
# To disable the mode, use the same command again or press {{KEY|Esc}}.

==Preferences==

This command is a manual toggle that provides a more forceful "click-through" behavior than the automatic settings available in the [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]]. It differs by making the entire panel non-interactive, not just the transparent parts, and it remains active until toggled off.

The related automatic settings can be found at {{MenuCommand|Edit → Preferences → Display → UI → Overlay}}:
* '''Automatically pass through of the mouse cursor''': Automatically passes mouse clicks through the transparent areas of an overlay panel.
* '''Automatically pass through of the mouse wheel''': Automatically passes mouse wheel events through the transparent areas of an overlay panel.
