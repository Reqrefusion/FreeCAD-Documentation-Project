==Description==

The [[File:Spreadsheet_SetAlias.svg|24px]] '''Spreadsheet SetAlias''' tool opens a dialog to define an alias for a cell. A cell can be referenced by its address (capital column letter + row number, e.g. B4) or by its alias.

==Usage==

# Make sure there is an active [[Spreadsheet_CreateSheet|spreadsheet]].
# Select a cell.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Spreadsheet_SetAlias.svg|16px]] [[Spreadsheet_SetAlias|Set Alias]]}} button.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|Ctrl}}+{{KEY|Shift}}+{{KEY|A}}.
# Enter an alias:
#* Only alphanumeric characters and underscores ({{incode|A}} to {{incode|Z}}, {{incode|a}} to {{incode|z}}, {{incode|0}} to {{incode|9}} and {{incode|_}}) are allowed.
#* The first character must be a letter.
#* Using 1 or 2 capital letters followed by 1 to 5 numbers, for example {{incode|AB123}}, is not allowed as this is considered a cell address.
#* Character sequences that are units are not allowed. For example {{incode|W}} is an invalid alias as it is the unit for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt Watt]. Since FreeCAD supports many units it is best to avoid short aliases. See [[Expressions#Units|Expressions]].
#* Using the mathematical constants {{incode|pi}} and {{incode|e}} as aliases will lead to errors and should be avoided.
#* Do not use spaces in aliases as they will also lead to errors.
