== Description ==

'''CSV2Objects''' generates large batches of 3D objects with text driven by CSV files.
It uses horizontal guide lines in a sketch to position text, creates ShapeStrings,
extrudes them, and optionally fuses the result with a target solid. It supports batch
export to STL, 3MF, and STEP.

== Installation ==

You can install the macro in several ways:

* Via the '''Addon Manager''' (Macros tab) once this macro is indexed.
* Manually by downloading the macro file from GitHub:

  [https://github.com/DasLukas/CSV2Objects/raw/main/CSV2Objects.FCMacro CSV2Objects.FCMacro]

  and copying it into your FreeCAD macro directory.

== Usage ==

# Open a document with a sketch containing horizontal guide lines, and optionally a target solid.
# Run the macro '''CSV2Objects.FCMacro''' from the Macro menu.
# In the task panel, choose a CSV file, encoding and delimiter.
# Scan guide lines and assign CSV columns to each active line.
# Choose a font, extrusion height, boolean mode and export format (STL/3MF/STEP).
# Use the live preview to adjust your settings.
# Press '''OK''' to generate and export the geometry for all CSV rows.
# Press '''Cancel''' to clear preview objects and close the dialog.
