== Introduction == <!--T:17-->

<!--T:1-->
This is the documentation wiki of [https://freecad.org FreeCAD]. There are several ways to use this documentation: by exploring the hubs, by following the manual, or by using the Help menu entries from within FreeCAD. This is a work in progress, written by the community of users and developers of FreeCAD. If you find information that is wrong or missing, please [[Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD|help FreeCAD]]!

== The hubs == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
 [[Image:Crystal_Clear_app_display.png|64px|left]] [[User_hub|Users hub]]: This page contains documentation useful for FreeCAD users in general: a list of all the workbenches, detailed instructions on how to install and use the FreeCAD application, tutorials, and all you need to get started.

== Get involved == <!--T:7-->

=== How to participate === <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
There is plenty to do inside the FreeCAD project, if you are interested in helping us. Of course, there are programming tasks for C++ or Python programmers, but there are also many things you can do even if you cannot code, such as 
* writing documentation and [[WikiPages|editing the wiki (en)]] 
* helping newcomers
* translating the application and documentation
* helping with the packaging of the latest release of FreeCAD for your favourite operating system
* helping other people around you to discover FreeCAD. 

<!--T:16-->
The [[Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD|help FreeCAD]] page describes it all with more details. Starting from 2016, FreeCAD also participates in the [[Google_Summer_of_Code|Google Summer of Code]].

=== Source code === <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
FreeCAD can be compiled on all platforms using [https://cmake.org/ CMake].
