== TechDraw Drawing Examples and Draft Snap Dimensions ==

Hi Roy, 

the TechDraw Drawing Examples page was named to match with TechDraw Section Examples which also lists what TechDraw can do (and what not, yet). Was it necessary to move/rename it to TechDraw Examples? 

The Draft Snap Dimensions tool has to be finished with a click to confirm the point like all real snap tools, too. Why shouldn't this last step not be mentioned?

--[[User:FBXL5|FBXL5]] ([[User talk:FBXL5|talk]]) 08:21, 6 July 2023 (UTC)

: "TechDraw Drawing Examples" is a strange title. "Drawing" is redundant and also too reminiscent of the obsolete Drawing WB. Maybe then use "TechDraw General Examples"?

: BTW: Why do you say: "some examples about what TechDraw is already capable to do". It implies that TD is still underdeveloped when that is hardly the case.

: Regarding Draft Snap Dimensions: The tool itself does not suggest a point to the user, therefore there is nothing to confirm. So the text would have to be different.

:: In the end I can live with both alternatives with a light tendency towards General Examples.

:: TD is underdeveloped if we have to define section views in 3d space, have no real auxiliary views, cannot rotate a view without messing with the dimensions, have no view grid starting at a meaningful point and following the view's axes, cannot rotate balloons. Maybe I will find some more. Yes TD has made a leap forward with the extensions, but they also have some potential for improvement.

:: If we do not care about standards, FreeCAD is great, but it wants to be an application for professionals, too and there still lies some way to go towards this goal. This examples page is intended be used as a base of discussion, and to clarify terms that I or other not natives maybe use wrong. It is quite hard to find create simple examples to describe missing features in contrast to existing ones.

:: Regarding snapping: I read it as confirm the (new) end point of the current line segment rather than to confirm the (existing) selected point.

Thanks for clarifying. I have renamed the example page to [[TechDraw_General_Examples|TechDraw General Examples]]. I have removed the 2 redirects that were automatically created.

I'll look at Draft Snap Dimensions again later.

== Sketcher Offset ==

Hi Roy, I wonder if the shortcut of Sketcher Offset has changed as the tool tip says '''Offset geometries (Z, O)''' (and also not geometry).

--[[User:FBXL5|FBXL5]] ([[User talk:FBXL5|talk]]) 09:58, 6 December 2023 (UTC)

: I have made a PR to change the menu text and the shortcut ("Z, O" was already in use):
: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11656
: I should have mentioned this in my Wiki edits, sorry for the confusion.

: --[[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 20:49, 6 December 2023 (UTC)

::I see... It is a good idea to mention a forthcoming PR if changes are not yet visible as David69 also spotted the change from geometries to geometry in the GuiCommand section.

== Default image size ==

Hi Roy,

what is the default image size of the images in the first sentence. You undo my change from 32 to 24 px. But when I take an inspiration e.g. in the [[Part Box]] or any other page, the size of this icon is almost 24 px.

So what did I miss? [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 17:35, 14 September 2025 (UTC)

:Oops, I see that I have made a mistake there. I thought that 32px was the (de facto) standard for 'main' workbench pages. But that is actually not the case. I'll revert my edit. Sorry for the confusion. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 18:41, 14 September 2025 (UTC)
::Appreciate! [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 21:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)

== Notification About Text Changes ==

I saw that you have changed a lot of text recently, are you using the [[Special:ReplaceText|ReplaceText]] tool for this? If you don't use it, I recommend it. [[User:Reqrefusion|Reqrefusion]] ([[User talk:Reqrefusion|talk]]) 13:06, 23 September 2025 (UTC)

:Thanks, I recently discovered that tool myself. It is quite useful for the current "Title Case mod". [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 12:58, 25 September 2025 (UTC)

== Clean up {{Emphasis|See also:}} ==

Hello Roy,

is it worth to equalize the usage of {{Emphasis|See also:}} after the scripting heading? [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 12:11, 4 October 2025 (UTC)

:Thanks, yes we should do that. But there is a special tool (available to Administrators) to globally replace texts. So it does not make sense to do this manually. But, sadly, the tool does not work on translations.
:At the moment I don't want to change this text for all (100+) pages. I will try to include this when I continue with the "Title Case mod". I am doing that step-by-step to keep things manageable for translators and also for myself. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 15:22, 7 October 2025 (UTC)
::I could actually make a hack to do something like this in the relevant tool, but I'm not sure how well it would work. [[User:Reqrefusion|Reqrefusion]] ([[User talk:Reqrefusion|talk]]) 18:24, 7 October 2025 (UTC)
:::Hopefully it works well.
:::I start a new thread in the forum in which I asked for a plugin or template tool to auto-translate identical Strings like '== Introduction =='. Maybe this could be a huge improvement in the manual translation process of identical translations a thousand times and more. [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 18:47, 9 October 2025 (UTC)
::No hurry, I think there are more important things at the moment. I found this and with the new superuser text replacement tool, this could be a simple task. [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 18:45, 9 October 2025 (UTC)

== The use of from or by ==

Hi Roy,

I stumbled across the term 'arc from 3 points' while translating this morning, and just now, I got a similar message due to a camel case change you made.

I took a short look into the dictionary and the wide internet and in most CAD programs the wording for the arc case is whether '3-point arc‘ (more precise) or 'Arc by 3 Points‘. The wording with ‚from' is less precise and not often used.

Is this worth to equalize the wording?

:I understand why you ask this, but "Arc From 3 Points" is the new text that has recently replaced the previous text
:"Arc by 3 points". Switching back after only a couple of months would be strange I think. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 16:17, 15 October 2025 (UTC)
::Switching back depends not on time. ;-) [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 16:26, 15 October 2025 (UTC)

== Single word sentences ==

Hi Roy

'Nothing incorrect about a single word sentence in my part of the world.'

What about the five single word sentences in the lines above? [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 16:49, 19 October 2025 (UTC)

:I see 1 extra example but not 4. So please clarify. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 18:40, 19 October 2025 (UTC)
::In the last table row there was a, from my point of view, missing dot after the last word 'Idem' in the table. The four rows above ended all with the String 'Idem.‘, so I added a single dot. What’s wrong with this? [[User:C4e|C4e]] ([[User talk:C4e|talk]]) 19:34, 19 October 2025 (UTC)
