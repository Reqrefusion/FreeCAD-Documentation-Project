''이번 FreeCAD 배포는 2017년에 우리를 떠난 친구 Roland Frank[https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=25673]에게 헌정되었습니다. 그는 FreeCAD 포럼의 활동적이고 좋은 평가를 받는 회원이었습니다.그리고 그가 만든 비디오 자습서[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEvhclR4-o&list=PL6fZ68Cq3L8k0JhxnIVjZQN26cn9idJrj FreeCAD 배우기] 와 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m49z0weonog&list=PLsrwVwvqYb8G4Ri0iz1JIebsOXkgoytAY BPLFRE] YouTube 채널은 많은 사람들이 FreeCAD를 시작하는 데 도움이 되었습니다.''</div>
FreeCAD 0.17은 2018년 4월 6일에 출시되었습니다. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.17 GitHub]에서 다운로드하세요. 이것은 가장 흥미로운 변경 사항을 요약한 것입니다. 전체 변경 목록은 [https://www.freecad.org/tracker/changelog_page.php?version_id=73 MantisBT bugtracker FC 0.17 변경 기록]에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
 
이전 FreeCAD 배포 기록은 [[Feature list/ko|배포 기록]]에서 찾을 수 있습니다.

== 괄목할만한 부분 ==

이전 0.16 배포 이후 2년이 지났지만 FreeCAD 팀은 그 기간 동안 가만히 있지 않았습니다. FreeCAD 소스 코드에는 6,800개 이상의 개정판이 추가되었습니다. 비교해 보면 이는 v0.16과 0.15 사이에 수행된 작업의 3배 이상입니다! 기존 작업대는 대부분 개선되었고, 완전히 새로운 작업대 2개가 추가되었습니다. 커뮤니티에서는 새로운 추가 모듈도 개발했습니다. 주요 내용:


'''부품설계 작업대'''가 완전히 개편되었습니다. 이제 새로운 몸통 컨테이너에는 일련의 기능이 포함되어 있으며 스케치를 평면형 면에 매핑해야 하는 요구 사항이 높아졌습니다. 점, 축, 평면과 같은 기준도형(참조) 형상을 생성하는 새로운 도구를 사용하면 부품설계 작업방법이 훨씬 더 다양해집니다.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New [[Arch Schedule]] tool: This tool has been completely rewritten, and now offers much more flexible ways to gather data from the document into a spreadsheet, using different kinds of queries, such as counting all objects of a certain type, or summing up the total volume of a certain category of objects.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New set of [[Arch Pipe|piping tools]] to design piping systems. You can use lines, sketches or wires as a base to place tubes, and automatically create connections between 2 or 3 tubes.

</div> 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New [[Arch Panel Cut|Panel tools]] were specifically designed for panel constructions. They allow building a model composed of [[Arch Panel|Arch Panels]], and then generating cutting sheets that can be used by the [[Path Workbench]] to generate cutting machine code.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Draft_Slope|Slope tool]]: When used on a [[Draft Line]] or [[Draft Wire]], this tool will allow you to give it a specific slope/inclination. That is, the intermediate and end points will get a lower Z value, so the whole object gets a constant inclination. This is useful to use Lines or Wires as bases for objects that need a precise inclination, such as roof panes or sewer pipes.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* [[Draft_SetWorkingPlaneProxy|Working Plane proxies]]: When working with [[Draft SelectPlane|Draft working planes]], you often need to store working plane locations that you use often. This is now possible by placing one of these proxies in your document. It will remember the current working plane location, and can also restore the current view and/or objects visibility.
</div>

== 부품설계 작업대 ==

[[PartDesign_Workbench/ko|부품설계 작업대]]는 5년에 걸쳐 여러 개발자가 함께 노력한 결과로 엄청난 변화를 겪었습니다.
[[Image:PartDesign017-teaser-motor-core.png|800px]]
* 새로운 [[PartDesign Body/ko|몸통(Body)]]라는 그릇에는 단일 연속 고체를 구성하는 일련의 [[PartDesign_Feature/ko|도형특징들]]을 담을 수 있습니다. 또한 객체를 부착할 표준 평면과 축도 담고  있습니다. 몸통이라는 그릇 덕분에 도형에 특징을 추가할 때 더 이상 스케치를 면에 매핑할 필요가 없습니다. 이 요구 사항은 매개 변수 변경 시 많은 모델이 깨져버릴 수 있는 이전 부품설계에서의 가장 큰 한계였습니다. 따라서 이제 가능하면 스케치를 면에 매핑하지 않는 것이 좋습니다.

* 새로운 덧셈/뺄셈적 도형특징들: [[PartDesign_CompPrimitiveAdditive|Primitives]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveLoft|Loft]], [[PartDesign_AdditivePipe|Sweep]], [[PartDesign_Thickness|Thickness]].

* 새로운 기준도형 특징인 [[PartDesign_Plane|planes]], [[PartDesign_Line|lines]] 및 [[PartDesign_Point|points]]는 스케치 배치, 정렬 및 회전축 역할에 유용합니다.

* 부품설계 작업대와 스케치 작업대 간의 새로운 자동 전환. 부품설계 작업대 내에서 새 스케치를 생성할 때 스케치 부착이 설정되면 UI는 자동으로 편집 모드의 스케치 작업대 및 해당 도구로 전환됩니다. 스케치가 닫히면 UI가 다시 부품설계 작업대로 전환되고 뷰가 이전 상태로 복원됩니다. 따라서 새로운 부품설계 작업을 위한 공간을 확보하기 위해 스케치 도구가 부품설계 도구 모음에서 제거되었습니다.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Path Workbench==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The Path workbench has been massively overhauled in version 0.17. The overhaul saw the removal of all older HeeksCNC code and replacement of the libarea python wrapper with the new Path-Area module. As a result operations have gotten much more powerful, faster, with a simplified code base.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Support for 2.5D operations is complete including [[Path_Profile|contour]], [[Path MillFace|face-milling]], [[Path Pocket Shape|pocketing]], [[Path_Profile|profiling]], and [[Path Drilling|drilling]]

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Introduction of [[Path Job]]. The job is now a central object of the path workflow.  It organizes and coordinates multiple operations, tools, stock material, part orientation and alignment.  A customized Job can be saved as a 'Job Template' and re-used to streamline the setup of future jobs.  Job SetupSheets provide a mechanism to automate the configuration of depth and speed settings.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* All operations have a consistent task panel organization

== Sketcher Workbench ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Sketches can now be attached in a wide variety of ways, not only to flat faces as it used to be. Of particular importance is attachment perpendicular to edges, useful for making profiles for [[Part Sweep|sweeping]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* External geometry links are no longer limited to only the object the sketch is mapped to. Geometry from other sketches is supported. External geometry links can be created within a Part container, or a Body container, or even a whole project if Part and Body containers are not used.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Visibility automation: now, when you start editing a sketch, objects depending on it are automatically hidden to unclutter the view, and objects used for external geometry links are automatically shown; old visibilities are restored as you close the sketch.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* New constraint continuous creation mode: constraint tools are now active even without any element selected. Press a constraint, then select objects to apply the constraint to.

* Constraints List box includes ability to hide internal alignment, as well as individual hiding of constraints with a checkbox.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The Block constraint removes all degrees of freedom for a geometry element in place with the use of a single constraint. It should be particularly useful to work with B-Splines, which are cumbersome to constrain.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* The solver now automatically substitutes a combination of coincident constraint + tangent constraint with a point-on-point tangent constraint, as the former is an improper use that induces tolerance error that can cause further problems in the model. The user is advised of the substitution by a dialog which can be disabled in Sketcher preferences by unchecking "Notify automatic constraint substitutions".

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[TechDraw Workbench|TechDraw]] is a new workbench for creating technical drawings that aims to replace the aging Drawing workbench. FreeCAD v0.17 is still shipped with the Drawing workbench so you can still open and edit your files containing Drawing pages, but Drawing will be phased out in a future release. Some of the exciting new stuff that TechDraw brings:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Most tools from the Drawing workbench have a TechDraw counterpart.
* Easier view creation and manipulation. Views can be grabbed by their border with the mouse and dragged on the page. Orthogonal views alignment can be locked.
* Better line type management (hard, smooth, iso, seam). Better hidden line removal thanks to an updated [[Glossary#OCC|OCC]] library.
* Section view, detail view creation.
* Better template management.
* Dimensioning is now supported, through multiple dimensioning tools: horizontal, vertical, length, radial, diameter, angular.
