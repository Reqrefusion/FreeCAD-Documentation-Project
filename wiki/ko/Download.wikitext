=== Notes for Windows users ===

* The following Windows versions are supported: 64-bit 8/10/11.
* The package can also be installed from the [https://chocolatey.org/packages/freecad Chocolatey] manager. The Chocolatey package is currently not up-to-date.

=== Notes for macOS users ===

* MacOS 10.12 Sierra is the minimum supported version.
* For macOS 12 and older the "Unsigned Intel disk image" should be used, the signed version does not work on those systems.

=== Notes for GNU/Linux users ===

Most distributions carry FreeCAD in their official repositories, however, if the distribution doesn't follow a rolling release model the version they provide might be outdated. Instead you can download the AppImage above, mark it as executable and launch it without installation.

Please see the [[Installing_on_Linux|Installing on Linux]] page for more installation options, including daily packages for Ubuntu and derivatives.

A portable version that doesn't need installation can be achieved by starting FreeCAD with these commands:

{{Code|lang=text|code=
cd path/to/directory_containing_AppImage/
chmod +x ./name_of_AppImage_file.AppImage
HOME="$PWD/Settings" FREECAD_USER_HOME="$PWD/Settings" ./name_of_AppImage_file.AppImage
}}

More information about FreeCAD's environment variables can be found on [[Start_up_and_Configuration#Environment_variables|the configuration page]].

== Development versions ==

FreeCAD's development is active.
* For development builds and development source code, see the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/weekly-builds weekly builds] page. Weekly builds are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows there. For Linux, daily builds are also available: use the [[Ubuntu_Snap|snap package]]'s edge channel or the [https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily FreeCAD daily PPA] (the later only for Debian-based distributions).
* To compile the latest source code, see [[Compiling|compiling]].

== Additional modules and macros ==

The FreeCAD community provides many additional modules and macros. Since 0.17 they can be easily installed from within FreeCAD using the [[Image:Std_AddonMgr.svg|24px]] [[Std_AddonMgr|Addon manager]].
