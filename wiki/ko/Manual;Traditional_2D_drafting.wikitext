FreeCAD의 Draft 작업대(workbench)는 2D 제도와 3D 모델링을 연결하는 다리 역할을 하며, AutoCAD와 같은 전통적인 2D CAD 시스템과 비교했을 때 독특한 위치를 차지합니다. FreeCAD는 완전한 3D 환경에서 작동하지만, Draft 작업대(workbench)는 사용자에게 익숙한 2D 도면 도구를 제공하는 동시에 2D 스케치와 3D 객체 사이를 부드럽게 전환할 수 있는 유연성을 제공합니다.
예를 들어, 특정 면이나 방향에 맞춰 사용자 정의 작업 평면을 설정한 뒤 그 위에 도형을 그릴 수 있으며, 이를 통해 파라메트릭 모델을 구성할 수 있습니다. 또한 FreeCAD는 파라메트릭 방식이기 때문에, 치수를 변경하면 프로젝트 전체에 걸쳐 그 변경 사항이 자동으로 반영됩니다.

Draft 작업대(workbench)의 강점 중 하나는 기본적인 그리기 도구부터 고급 수정 도구까지 포함한 포괄적인 도구 세트에 있습니다. 이러한 도구들은 2D 제도 작업뿐만 아니라 3D 공간에서 객체를 조작하는 데에도 사용할 수 있습니다. 작업 평면을 설정하고, 그리드를 정의하며, 구속조건을 적용함으로써 설계 전반에 걸쳐 기하학적 관계가 유지되도록 할 수 있습니다. Draft 객체는 스냅 모드와 다양한 구속조건을 활용해 수정하고 재배치할 수 있어, 정밀한 제도 작업을 훨씬 수월하게 만들어 줍니다.

Draft 작업대(workbench)에 포함된 주요 도구들은 다음과 같습니다:

# 그리기 도구(Drawing Tools):
* [[Image:Draft_Line.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Line|Line]], [[Image:Draft_Wire.svg|16px]] [Draft_Wire|Wire] : 직선 선분이나 연속된 폴리라인을 생성할 수 있으며, 구속조건을 적용하고 3D 형상으로 변환할 수 있습니다.
* [[Image:Draft_Circle.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Circle|Circle]], [[Image:Draft_Ellipse.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Ellipse|Ellipse]], [[Image:Draft_Arc.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Arc|Arc]]: 기본적인 원형 및 타원형 형상을 정의하는 데 사용되며, 이후 추가적인 조작이 가능합니다.
# 조작 도구(Manipulation Tools):
* [[Image:Draft_Move.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Move|Move]], [[Image:Draft_Rotate.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Rotate|Rotate]], [[Image:Draft_Scale.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Scale|Scale]]: 2D뿐만 아니라 3D 공간에서도 동작하여 객체 배치에 높은 유연성을 제공합니다.
* [[Image:Draft_Offset.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Offset|Offset]]: 전통적인 CAD 시스템과 유사하게, 평행한 선이나 곡선을 생성할 수 있습니다.
* [[Image:Draft_Trimex.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Trimex|Trimex]] 및 [[Image:Draft_Stretch.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Stretch|Stretch]]: 선과 형상을 잘라내거나 연장하여 다른 객체와 교차하거나 맞닿도록 수정합니다.
* [[Image:Draft_Mirror.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Mirror|Mirror]] 및 [[Image:Draft_Array.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Array|Array]]: 객체를 복제하고 배열을 생성하는 도구로, 반복되는 구성 요소에 적합합니다.

FreeCAD의 Draft 작업대(workbench)에 포함된 스냅 시스템은 정밀한 작업을 위해 설계되었습니다. 2D든 3D든 관계없이, 끝점, 중점, 원의 중심과 같은 중요한 지점에 스냅할 수 있어 요소들을 서로 정확하게 배치하기가 쉽습니다. 수직, 접선, 교차점과 같은 스냅 모드는 정밀도를 더욱 높여 줍니다. 이러한 기능들은 작업 평면 및 그리드 시스템과 결합되어, 객체와 구성 요소를 정확하게 정렬할 수 있도록 보장합니다.

FreeCAD의 파라메트릭 특성 덕분에 Draft 작업대(workbench)에서 작성한 요소들에도 구속조건을 적용할 수 있어, 기하학적 관계가 항상 유지되도록 할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 선들을 서로 평행하거나 수직이 되도록 만들거나, 요소들 사이의 거리를 고정할 수 있습니다. 이러한 구속조건은 나중에 다시 조정할 수 있으므로, 설계 변경이 프로젝트 전반에 걸쳐 부드럽고 일관되게 반영됩니다. 또한 Draft 작업대(workbench)는 보다 엄격한 파라메트릭 2D 설계를 위한 Sketcher 작업대(workbench), 그리고 문서화를 위한 기술 2D 도면을 생성하는 TechDraw 작업대(workbench) 등 다른 FreeCAD 작업대들과도 원활하게 연동됩니다.

Advanced features of the Draft Workbench include the ability to import and export files in formats like DXF and SVG, allowing you to work with or share designs with users of other CAD programs. Python scripting further enhances FreeCAD’s capabilities, allowing you to automate tasks or create custom workflows. You can write scripts that generate draft objects based on specific geometric rules, streamlining repetitive tasks.

To showcase the workflow and possibilities of the Draft Workbench, we will walk through a simple exercise, the result of which will be this little drawing, showing the floor plan of a small house that contains only a kitchen top (A pretty absurd floor plan, but we can do what we want here, can't we?):

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_01.jpg]]

* Switch to the '''Draft Workbench'''
* As in all technical drawing applications, it is wise to set up your environment correctly, it will save you a lot of time. If you wish to personalize your experience in the Draft Workbench, you can easily do so by adjusting various settings in the Draft Preferences Panel by going to '''Edit → Preferences → Draft'''. In this exercise, however, we will act as if these settings were left at their default values.

[[File:FreeCAD DraftPreferences.png]]

* The Draft Preferences Panel in FreeCAD allows you to customize various aspects of your 2D drafting environment. In the '''General Settings''', you can define the default working plane, adjust decimal precision, and set the default line width, style, and color for objects. The '''Grid and Snapping''' section enables you to control grid visibility, spacing, and snapping modes, allowing for precise alignment and positioning of elements. The '''Visual Style''' options let you customize the appearance of objects and the grid, including line and fill colors. In '''Text and Dimensions''', you can configure the default text size, font, and color for annotations, ensuring clarity in technical drawings.

[[Image:Draft_toolbars.png]]

* Turning on all the snap buttons is convenient, but also makes drawing slower, as more calculation needs to be done when you move the mouse cursor. It is often better to keep only the ones you will actually use.

* Let's start by turning '''construction mode''' on, which will allow us to draw some guidelines on which we will draw our final geometry. You can do that by pressing on the [[Image:Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.svg|24px]] [[Draft_ToggleConstructionMode|Toggle construction mode]] command.
* If you prefer, you can set the working plane to XY. This will lock the working plane, ensuring it remains on the XY plane regardless of how you change the view. If you choose not to do this, the working plane will automatically adapt to the current view, meaning you'll need to ensure you're in the top view whenever you want to draw on the XY (ground) plane to avoid unintended shifts in orientation.

Let's begin laying out the basic shape of our floorplan.

* Press the [[Image:Draft_Rectangle.svg|24px]] '''Draft Rectangle''' button
* Draw a 2-meter by 2-meter rectangle starting from point (0,0,0), leave the Z coordinate at zero. You can efficiently complete this entire process using the keyboard, without needing the mouse. Simply type:
** '''re''', '''Enter''',  '''Enter''',  '''Enter''',  2m, '''Enter''',  2m, '''Enter''',  0 and '''Enter'''.
This keyboard-driven workflow speeds up drafting, especially when working with repetitive tasks or precision input, making it ideal for users looking to streamline their workflow. You can view the keystrokes for every object by hovering over the corresponding button.

* Duplicate that rectangle by 15cm inside, using the [[Image:Draft_Offset.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Offset|Offset]] tool, turning its Copy mode on, and giving it a distance of 15cm:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_02.png]]

* We can then draw a couple of vertical lines to define where our doors and windows will be placed, using the [[Image:Draft_Line.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Line|Line]] tool (note that the "relative" mode box should be unchecked for this step). The crossing of these lines with our two rectangles will give us useful intersections to snap our walls to. Draw the first line by defining the following points:
** '''P1''' (15cm, 1m, 0) and '''P2''' (15cm, 3m, 0).
* We will now duplicate this line 5 times. Press on the [[Image:Draft_Move.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Move|Move]] tool with  [[Image:Draft_Clone.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Clone|Clone]] mode turned on. Make sure '''Relative mode''' is enabled. Copy mode ensures that each movement creates a new line instead of shifting the original, while Relative mode allows you to define movements based on relative distances, making positioning easier without needing to calculate exact coordinates. Start by selecting the original line, and initiate the move operation by choosing any starting point, such as (0,0,0). After each move, perform the next operation on the newly created line, so each copy builds on the previous one. Define the relative endpoints for each new line
** line001: x: 10cm
** line002: x: 120cm
** line003: x: -55cm, y: -2m
** line004: x: 80cm
** line005: x: 15cm

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_03.jpg]]

* That is all we need now, so we can switch construction mode off. Check that all the construction geometry has been placed into a "Construction" group, which makes it easy to hide it all at once or even delete it completely later on.
* Now let's draw our two wall pieces using the [[Image:Draft_Wire.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Wire|Wire]] tool. Make sure the [[Image:Draft_Snap_Intersection.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap|intersection snap]] is turned on, as we will need to snap to the intersections of our lines and rectangles. Draw two wires as follows, by clicking all the points of their contours. To close them, either click on the first point again or press the '''Close''' button:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_04.jpg]]

* We can give the walls a nice hatch pattern. Select both walls, make sure their '''Make Face''' property (located on the Data tab) is set to '''TRUE''', then set their '''Pattern''' property (located on the View tab) to '''Simple''', and their '''Pattern size''' to your liking, for example '''0.01'''. 

[[File:Draft Pattern.png]]

* We can now hide the construction geometry by right-clicking the Construction group and choose '''Hide Selection'''.
* Let's now draw the windows and doors. Make sure the [[Image:Draft_Snap_Midpoint.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Snap|midpoint snap]] is turned on, and draw six lines as shown below:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_06.jpg]]

* We will now change the door line to create an opened door symbol. Start by rotating the line using the [[Image:Draft_Rotate.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Rotate|Rotate]] tool. Click the endpoint of the line as rotation center; then specify a base angle of '''0''', and a rotation of '''-90'''.
* Then create the opening arc with the [[Image:Draft_Arc.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Arc|Arc]] tool. Pick the same point as the rotation center we used in the previous step as the center, click the other point of the line to give the radius, then the start and end points as follows:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_07.jpg]]

* We can now start placing some furniture. To begin with, let's place a counter by drawing a rectangle from the upper left inner corner, and giving it a width of 170cm and a height of -60cm. In the image below, the '''Transparency''' property of the rectangle is set to 80%, to give it a nice furniture look.
* Then let's add a sink and a cooktop. Drawing these kinds of symbols by hand can be very tedious, and they are usually easy to find on the internet, for example on http://www.cad-blocks.net. In the '''Downloads''' section below, for convenience, we separated a sink and a cooktop from this project and saved them as DXF files. You can download these two files by visiting the links below, and right-clicking the '''Raw''' button, then choosing '''save as'''.
* Inserting a DXF file into an opened FreeCAD document can be done either by choosing the '''File → Import''' menu option, or by dragging and dropping the DXF file from your file explorer into the FreeCAD window. The contents of the DXF files might not appear right on the center of your current view, depending on where they were in the DXF file. You can use the menu '''View → Standard views → Fit all''' to zoom out and find the imported objects. Insert the two DXF files, and move them to a suitable location on the tabletop:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_08.jpg]]

* We can now place a couple of dimensions using the [[Image:Draft_Dimension.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Dimension|Dimension]] tool. To create a dimension, you start by selecting three points: the first point sets the start of the measurement, the second point defines the endpoint, and the third point determines where the dimension line and text will be placed. By clicking these points carefully, you ensure that the dimension accurately represents the distance between the two selected points. If you want to force the dimension to be perfectly horizontal or vertical, even if the start and end points are not aligned, hold down the '''Shift''' key while clicking the second point. This locks the dimension into the desired orientation. You can further refine the dimension by adjusting properties such as text size, precision, and color in the properties panel, ensuring the dimensions fit your project’s visual and technical standards.
* You can change the position of a dimension text by double-clicking the dimension in the tree view. A control point will allow you to move the text graphically. In our exercise, the "0.15" texts have been moved away for better clarity.
* You can change the contents of the dimension text by editing their '''Override''' property. In our example, the texts of the door and window dimensions have been edited to indicate their heights:

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_09.jpg]]

* Let's add some description texts using the [[Image:Draft_Text.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Text|Text]] tool. Click a point to position the text, then enter the lines of text, pressing Enter after each line. To finish, press Enter twice.
* The indication lines (also called "leaders") that link the texts to the item they are describing are simply done with the Wire tool. Draw wires, starting from the text position, to the place being described. Once that is done, you can add a bullet or arrow at the end of the wires by setting their '''End Arrow''' property to '''TRUE'''

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_10.jpg]]

* Our drawing is now complete! Given the number of objects in the design, it’s a good idea to do some tidying up and restructuring before we consider it finished. Organizing everything into clear, logical groups will not only help keep the project well-structured but also make it significantly easier for others to navigate and understand the file. By grouping related elements—such as furniture, appliances, or architectural features—you can simplify the layout and improve the clarity of the design. This will also make future modifications or adjustments far more manageable, especially if the project needs to be shared or collaborated on. Additionally, a clean structure ensures that anyone reviewing the drawing can quickly locate specific elements without sifting through a cluttered workspace, ultimately contributing to a more professional and polished final product. Taking the extra time to organize now can save considerable time and effort later on.:

[[File:Draft Organised.png]]

* We can now print our work by placing it on a Drawing sheet, which we will show later in this manual, or directly export our drawing to other CAD applications, by exporting it to a DXF file. Simply select our "Floor plan" group, select the menu '''File → Export''', and select the '''Autodesk DXF''' format. The file can then be opened in any other 2D CAD application such as [http://www.librecad.org LibreCAD]. You might notice some differences, depending on the configurations of each application.

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_12.jpg]]

* The most important aspect of the Draft Workbench, however, is that the 2D geometry you create can serve as the foundation for creating 3D objects. You can easily extrude these shapes into 3D using the [[Image:Part_Extrude.svg|16px]] [[Part_Extrude|Part Extrude]] tool found in the [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]]. Alternatively, if you prefer to stay within the Draft Workbench, you can use the [[Image:Draft_Trimex.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Trimex|Trimex]] tool, which combines trim, extend, and extrusion functionalities. The Trimex tool essentially performs a Part Extrusion under the hood but does so "the Draft way," allowing you to visually indicate and snap the extrusion length, giving you greater control and precision when working directly within your drafting environment. This flexibility makes transitioning from 2D to 3D seamless and intuitive, especially for those familiar with 2D workflows, while still offering advanced 3D modeling capabilities. 
* By pressing the [[Image:Draft_SelectPlane.svg|16px]] [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]] button after selecting a face of an object, you are also able to place the working plane anywhere, and therefore draw Draft objects in different planes, for example on top of the walls. These can then be extruded to form other 3D solids. Experiment with setting the working plane on one of the top faces of the walls, then draw some rectangles up there. 

[[Image:Exercise_cabin_13.jpg]]

* All kinds of openings can also be done as easily by drawing Draft objects on the faces of walls, then extruding them, and then using the boolean tools from the Part Workbench to subtract them from another solid, as we saw in the previous chapter.

Fundamentally, the Draft Workbench provides a more graphical and intuitive approach to creating basic operations, similar to those found in the Part Workbench. In the Part Workbench, positioning objects often involves manually adjusting parameters like the Placement values (for position, rotation, etc.), which gives you precise control but can sometimes feel less intuitive, especially for quick edits. In contrast, the Draft Workbench allows you to perform these same operations visually on-screen, making it easier to move, rotate, and manipulate objects directly in the workspace with snapping tools and relative positioning options.

This difference is where the workbenches complement each other. The Draft Workbench is ideal for fast, interactive design, allowing you to draw and position objects without constantly entering precise numerical values. On the other hand, the Part Workbench offers more detailed, parametric control over object properties, making it better suited for highly accurate adjustments, especially in engineering or technical design projects.

The beauty of FreeCAD is that you don't need to choose between one or the other. You can create [[Interface_Customization|custom toolbars]] by combining tools from both the Draft and Part Workbenches, giving you the flexibility to switch between graphical and parametric methods as needed. This allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds—quick, on-screen adjustments from the Draft Workbench and the precision of the Part Workbench—depending on the needs of your project. Additionally, using keyboard shortcuts and custom toolbars can speed up your workflow, making it easy to transition between different operations without interrupting your design process.
