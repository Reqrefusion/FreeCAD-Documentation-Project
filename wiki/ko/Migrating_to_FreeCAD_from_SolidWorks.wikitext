== Overview ==

The intention of this page is to serve as a guide for users that are accustomed to the SolidWorks CAD/CAM workflow and want to migrate to FreeCAD.

== History ==

Understanding a little of the history of FreeCAD may help users comprehend it better: 
* FreeCAD was initially designed to behave parametrically using the [[Constructive_solid_geometry|Constructive solid geometry]] method (see the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]]). 
* Later it incorporated the [[Feature_editing|Feature editing]] method with the [[Image:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|24px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]]. SolidWorks also uses this approach.

== Tips ==

The [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] has many functions that are equivalent to SolidWorks. The image below identifies equivalent functions and their names on each platform, as well as functions that are unique to each platform.

== Topological naming problem ==

FreeCAD version 0.20 is still affected by the [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological naming problem]], but there are plans to fix this in the next version.

== Tutorials ==

List of helpful tutorials

There are many video tutorials online. Some of the more popular (at the time this was written) are by a Youtuber calling himself [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CubOaooNwC-3RBKUoAOQQ/videos '''Joko Engineeringhelp'''].

One of his tutorials is meant specifically for former SolidWorks users: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XXnulyKPNI
