== Introduction == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
{{Version|1.0}}

<!--T:5-->
The [[Image:Workbench_Material.svg|24px]] [[Material_Workbench|Material Workbench]] handles the FreeCAD material system.

== Tools == <!--T:6-->

<!--T:9-->
* [[Image:Material_Edit.svg|32px]] [[Material_Edit|Edit]]: Opens the Material Editor.

=== Related tools ===

While not provided by the Material workbench, these Material-related tools are included in FreeCAD's core and can be used without loading the workbench:

* [[Image:Std_SetMaterial.svg|32px]] [[Std_SetMaterial|Material]]: Assigns a material to the selected objects.

* [[Image:Std_SetAppearance.svg|32px]] [[Std_SetAppearance|Appearance]]: Sets the display properties of the selected objects. Often used after applying a material, when a given material does not define appearance properties.

== Working with materials ==

This guide explains the core concepts and workflows for using the Material system in FreeCAD. It covers the different tools, properties, and key technical details for both interactive and scripted use.

=== Material Editor and Material Selector ===

There are two primary interfaces for the material workflow, which serve separate and distinct purposes.

==== Material Editor ====

* '''Usage:''' Click the {{Button|[[Image:Material_Edit.svg|16px]] [[Material_Edit|Edit]]}} button in the Material Workbench.
* '''Purpose:''' The Material Editor is a tool for '''defining and managing your library of materials'''. Its sole function is to create new materials, edit the properties of existing ones, and organize them.
* '''Behavior:'''
** It is disconnected from your 3D model; selecting an object in your document has no effect on the editor.
** '''You cannot assign a material to an object from this window.''' Clicking {{Button|OK}} simply closes the editor.

==== Material Selector ====

* '''Usage:''' Select one or more objects in the [[3D_View|3D View]] or [[Tree_View|Tree View]], then select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Std_SetMaterial.svg|16px]] [[Std_SetMaterial|Material]]}} option from the context menu.
* '''Purpose:''' This tool is used exclusively to '''assign an existing material to the selected objects'''.
* '''Behavior:'''
** It opens a task panel containing a material browser tree.
** Selecting a material in this tree immediately applies its physical properties to the objects you have selected. This is the required step to link a material's physical data to a part.

=== Physical vs. appearance properties ===

A material in FreeCAD is defined by two distinct sets of properties:

* '''Physical properties:''' These define the engineering characteristics of a material, which are used for calculations and simulations (e.g., in the FEM Workbench). Examples include {{Incode|Density}}, {{Incode|YoungsModulus}}, and {{Incode|PoissonRatio}}.
* '''Appearance properties:''' These define the visual look of a material for rendering purposes. Examples include {{Incode|DiffuseColor}}, {{Incode|Shininess}}, and {{Incode|Transparency}}.

A material is not required to have both. Some materials might be defined only for analysis (with only physical properties), while others might be defined only for visualization (with only appearance properties).

=== Override material appearance ===

An object's final appearance is determined by a hierarchy. The visual properties set in a material can be overridden by local settings on the object itself.

* '''How to override:''' Select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Std_SetAppearance.svg|16px]] [[Std_SetAppearance|Appearance]]}} option from the object's [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or [[3D_View|3D View]] context menu. Any changes you make here will take precedence over the appearance properties of the assigned material.
* '''Caveats:''' This can be a source of confusion. If you have assigned a material to an object but its color doesn't change, it is likely because the object has a local appearance override. There is no clear visual indicator in the UI to show that an override is active. To restore the material's appearance, you must use the Appearance task panel to apply the material's visuals.

=== Properties ===

When you assign a material, FreeCAD links the data to the object and its view provider using two properties.

* {{PropertyData|Shape Material}}: This is the most important property. It is added to the '''Document Object'''. It holds a link to a full {{Incode|Materials::Material}} object, giving access to all its physical and appearance data for calculations and scripting. This is a [[Property_View#Context_menu|hidden property]].
* {{PropertyView|Shape Appearance}}: This property exists on the object's '''View Provider'''. It is a list that controls the final rendering of the object in the 3D View and is what gets modified when you use the [[Image:Std_SetAppearance.svg|16px]] [[Std_SetAppearance|Appearance]] task panel.

=== Scripting ===

You can get and set material properties using Python scripting. The primary methods are {{Incode|.getPhysicalValue()}} and {{Incode|.setPhysicalValue()}}.

{{Code|lang=python|code=
import FreeCAD
import FreeCADGui

# Get a reference to your object (e.g., a PartDesign Body)
obj = App.ActiveDocument.getObject("Body")

# --- Check for and Get a Property ---
if obj.ShapeMaterial.hasPhysicalProperty("Density"):
    
    # Get the value. This returns a FreeCAD.Quantity object.
    density_quantity = obj.ShapeMaterial.getPhysicalValue("Density")
    
    print(f"The material is: {obj.ShapeMaterial.Name}")
    print(f"The density is: {density_quantity}")
    print(f"Numerical value: {density_quantity.Value}")

else:
    print("The selected material does not have a 'Density' property.")


# --- Set a Property ---
# The value can be a string with units or a FreeCAD.Quantity object.
try:
    obj.ShapeMaterial.setPhysicalValue("Density", "8000 kg/m^3")
    App.ActiveDocument.recompute()
    print("Density successfully updated.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to set property: {e}")
}}
