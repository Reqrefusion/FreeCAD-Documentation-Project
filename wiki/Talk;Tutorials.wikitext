@vocx I do not agree with your split of Drawing tutorials VS. TechDraw tutorials. These sections are not sorted by workbenches, they are sorted by category: here, to make drawings. In the real world, there are not "tech drawings" opposed to "drawings". If you believe they should not appear in the Tutorials page because they are obsolete, then the point you should make is that they should be removed entirely, not placed in a separate "Drawings" category!
