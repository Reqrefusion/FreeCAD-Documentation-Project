<span id="Introduction"></span>
== Introdução ==

A [[File:Workbench_BIM.svg|24px]] [[BIM_Workbench| Bancada BIM ]] provê um fluxo de trabalho de  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling Modelo da Informação da Construção] moderno no FreeCAD, com objetos totalmente parametrizados como, por exemplo, paredes, vigas, telhados, janelas, escadas, canos, e móveis. Ela é compatível com arquivos [[Arch_IFC|Industry Foundation Classes]] (IFC), e a produção de plantas 2D em combinação com a [[File:Workbench_TechDraw.svg|16px]] [[TechDraw_Workbench|Bancada TechDraw]].

The BIM Workbench imports tools from the [[File:Workbench_Draft.svg|16px]] [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]], as it uses its 2D objects to build 3D parametric objects. But it can also use solid shapes created with other workbenches like [[File:Workbench_Part.svg|16px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part]] and [[File:Workbench_PartDesign.svg|16px]] [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign]].

Veja o [https://yorik.uncreated.net/blog/2020-010-freecad-bim-guide guia de migração FreeCAD BIM] (em ingês) para uma rápida visão geral se você for usuários de outra aplicação BIM.

Os desenvolvedores das bancadas aqDraft e BIM também colaboram com a [https://osarch.org comunidade OSArch], cujo principal objetivo é melhorar o design de construção usando unicamente software livre.

<span id="Getting_started"></span>
== Começando ==

[[Image:BIM_welcome_screen.png|800px]]

When starting the BIM workbench for the first time, a welcome dialog is shown, giving a quick overview of how the workbench works, and allowing the user to start an [[BIM_ingame_tutorial|in-game tutorial]]. The welcome dialog is also available from the '''help''' menu. When the welcome screen is closed by clicking OK, the [[BIM_Setup|BIM setup dialog]] will be shown, that allows the user to quickly set some of the most common BIM-related preferences of FreeCAD without the need to browse through the full [[Preferences_Editor|FreeCAD preferences pages]].

The [[BIM_Setup|BIM project setup]] tool allows you to quickly setup a BIM project by entering  some basic information about your project. You can then, for example, use the different 2D drafting tools to sketch guidelines and baselines, then use the different 3D modeling tools to automatically build 3D BIM objects from them. A line, for example, can become a wall simply by selecting it and pressing the [[Arch_Wall|Wall]] button.

Common building elements such as [[Arch_Wall|walls]] or [[BIM_Column|columns]] are easily created by pressing the appropriate toolbar button and clicking points in the 3D view. They can be moved, rotated and edited once created. Most BIM elements are created on the current [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]], so a typical workflow involves placing the working plane first, then creating a BIM element. More complex elements can be created by drawing 2D elements first, then using one of the BIM tools to convert them into the desired element.

Elements of building projects can be organized using [[Arch_Site|sites]], [[Arch_Building|buildings]] and [[Arch_BuildingPart|levels]], to reproduce what is commonly done in other BIM applications. In FreeCAD, however, such structures are not mandatory, and you are free to organize your model elements as you see fit, for example using [[Std_Group|groups]].

2D drawings can be generated from a model to represent plan, section or elevation views. To generate such a drawing,[[Arch_SectionPlane|section planes]] are placed in the model, to indicate where it should be cut or viewed from. Once the section planes are in place, two methods are possible:

# Create projected views in the document using [[Draft_Shape2DView|shape views]], then add all the necessary annotations such as texts and dimensions, then put all this on a page. This is the recommended way, as it offers more flexibility.
# Create a view on a page directly from the section plane. Then all the needed 2D annotations must either be added to the section plane, or done directly on the page. This is less flexible.

Finally, quantities schedules can be created using the [[Arch_Schedule|schedule]] tool.

If you are used to another BIM application, check our [[BIM_application_compatibility_table|BIM application compatibility table]] to get your bearings when starting with FreeCAD.

[[Image:BIM tutorial screenshot.png|800px]]

The [[BIM_ingame_tutorial|in-game tutorial]] is an easy way to quickly get on track with the BIM workbench.

== Tools ==

The BIM workbench gathers tools from several other FreeCAD workbenches, mainly [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]] and [[Part_Workbench|Part]], roughly reorganized in logical categories.

Additionally, if such [[External_workbenches|addons]] are installed, tools from [[Reinforcement_Workbench|Reinforcement]] (extra reinforcing bar tools), [[Fasteners_Workbench|Fasteners]] (bolts and screws), [[Flamingo_Workbench|Flamingo/Dodo]] (metal structure and piping tools) and [[Parts_Library_Workbench|Parts Library]] are automatically included in the BIM workbench.

The BIM workbench also adds a series of items in the '''status bar''' of FreeCAD, and a couple of '''context menu items''', accessible by right-clicking in the 3D view or in the tree view.

=== 2D drafting ===

2D objects are commonly used as drafting aids, or to draw base lines and profiles to build BIM objects on. They can also be used to draw symbols and annotations in your model. Apart from sketches, that use their own coordinate system, 2D objects will be drawn on the current [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]].

== Working with IFC ==

The BIM workbench works natively with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes Industry Foundation Classes] (IFC) files. Native means there is no more translation between the IFC contents and FreeCAD: The IFC contents are directly rendered in FreeCAD, and any change affects the IFC contents directly. Read more on [[NativeIFC|NativeIFC]].

If you don't plan to work with others, and have no need for IFC, you can still use the BIM workbench tools normally. You can still export your model to IFC anytime.

The old [[Arch IFC]] importer is disabled by default in FreeCAD, but still available from Python.
