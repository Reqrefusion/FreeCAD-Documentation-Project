== Introduction ==

<div class="mw-translate-fuzzy">
A '''Bancada de Desenho de Peças''' fornece ferramentas avançadas para modelar peças solidas complexas e baseia-se numa [[#Feature Editing Methodology|Metodologia de edição de recursos]]. Esta é foca-se principalmente, mas não apenas, na criação de peças mecânicas. Esta esta intrincadamente ligada com [[Sketcher Workbench/pt|A bancada Esboço (Sketcher)]].
</div>

The PartDesign Workbench uses a feature based methodology. A component is represented by the Body object container. The Body defines a local coordinate system and contains the cumulative features that define the component. Most features are based on parametric sketches and are either additive or subtractive. For example, the [[PartDesign_Pad|Pad tool]] adds the extruded sketch to the developing solid, the [[PartDesign_Pocket|Pocket tool]] subtracts the extruded sketch. Each feature is cumulative and builds on the result of preceding features. It is also possible to use primitives ([[PartDesign_AdditiveCylinder|Cylinder]], [[PartDesign_AdditiveSphere|Sphere]], etc.) as well as solids created outside the Body as features.

See the [[Feature_editing|feature editing]] page for a more complete explanation of this process, and then see [[Creating_a_simple_part_with_PartDesign|Creating a simple component with PartDesign]] to get started with creating solids.

The [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|16px]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] provides an alternative [[constructive_solid_geometry|constructive solid geometry]] (CSG) methodology for building shapes. For a detailed discussion of the Part Workbench versus the PartDesign Workbench see [[Part_and_PartDesign|Part and Part Design]].
