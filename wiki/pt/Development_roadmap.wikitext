The following links may help you get started:
* The [[Organization_chart|Organization chart]] shows who does what in the FreeCAD universe.
* The [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue current issues on GitHub].
* The [[:Category:Roadmap|Roadmap Category on this Wiki]]. Note that there are only very few pages in this category and as such they do not give a good representation of the current FreeCAD development.
