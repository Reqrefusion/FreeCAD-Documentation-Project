==Descrição==

This tool allows to build a 2D sheet, including any number of [[Arch_Panel_Cut|Arch Panel Cut]] objects, or any other 2D object such as those made by the [[Draft_Workbench|Draft Workbench]] and [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. The Panel Sheet is typically made to layout cuts to be made by a CNC machine. These sheets can then be exported to a [[Draft_DXF|DXF]] file.

''The above image shows how Panel Sheets appear when exported to DXF.''

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Utilização==

# Optionally, select one or more [[Arch_Panel_Cut|Arch Panel Cut]] objects or any other 2D object that lies on the XY plane.
# Select the {{MenuCommand|Utils → Panel tools → [[Image:Arch_Panel_Sheet.svg|16px]] Panel Sheet}} option from the menu.
# Adjust the desired properties.

<span id="Options"></span>
==Opções==

* After the panel sheet is created, with or without child objects, Any other child object can be added/removed to/from the panel sheet by double-clicking it in the tree view and adding or removing objects from its Group folder
* Double-clicking on the panel in the tree view also allows you to move the objects contained in this sheet, or move its tag
* It is possible to automatically make panels composed of more than one sheet of a material, by raising its Sheets property
* Panel Sheets can display a margin, that is useful to make sure a certain space is always present between inner objects and the border of the sheet
* When Panel sheets are exported to DXF, the outlines, inner holes, tags of their inner children are placed on different layers, as shown on the above image

<span id="Properties"></span>
==Propriedades==

===Data===

* {{PropertyData|Height}}: The height of the sheet
* {{PropertyData|Width}}: The width of the sheet
* {{PropertyData|Fill Ratio}}: The percentage of the sheet area that is filled by cuts (automatic)
* {{PropertyData|Tag Text}}: The text to display
* {{PropertyData|Tag Size}}: The size of the tag text
* {{PropertyData|Tag Position}}: The position of the tag text. Keep (0,0,0) for automatic center position
* {{PropertyData|Tag Rotation}}: The rotation of the tag text
* {{PropertyData|Font File}}: The font of the tag text
* {{PropertyData|Make Face}}: If True, the panel is a Part Face, otherwise a Part Wire
* {{PropertyData|Grain Direction}}: This allows you to inform the main direction of the panel fiber (clockwise direction, 0° means up)

===View===

* {{PropertyView|Margin}}: A margin that can be displayed inside the panel border
* {{PropertyView|Show Margin}}: Turns the display of the margin on/off
* {{PropertyView|Show Grain}}: Shows a fiber texture (Make Face must be set to True)

==Scripting==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch_API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Panel sheet tool can be used in [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:

{{Code|code=
Sheet = makePanelSheet(panels=[], name="PanelSheet")
}}

* Creates a {{incode|Sheet}} object from {{incode|panels}}, which is a list of [[Arch Panel|Arch Panel]] objects.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, Draft, Arch

Rect = Draft.makeRectangle(500, 200)
Polygon = Draft.makePolygon(5, 750)

p1 = FreeCAD.Vector(1000, 0, 0)
p2 = FreeCAD.Vector(2000, 400, 0)
p3 = FreeCAD.Vector(1250, 800, 0)
Wire = Draft.makeWire([p1, p2, p3], closed=True)

Panel1 = Arch.makePanel(Rect, thickness=36)
Panel2 = Arch.makePanel(Polygon, thickness=36)
Panel3 = Arch.makePanel(Wire, thickness=36)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

Cut1 = Arch.makePanelCut(Panel1)
Cut2 = Arch.makePanelCut(Panel2)
Cut3 = Arch.makePanelCut(Panel3)
Cut1.ViewObject.LineWidth = 3
Cut2.ViewObject.LineWidth = 3
Cut3.ViewObject.LineWidth = 3
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

Sheet = Arch.makePanelSheet([Cut1, Cut2, Cut3])
}}
