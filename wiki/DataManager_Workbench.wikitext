'''DataManager''' is a FreeCAD workbench for auditing and cleaning up:

* '''VarSets''' (<code>App::VarSet</code>) and their variables
* '''Spreadsheet aliases''' (<code>Spreadsheet::Sheet</code>) and their alias names

It helps you:

* Filter and browse VarSets/Spreadsheets and their child items.
* Inspect expression references to variables/aliases.
* Identify and remove '''unused''' variables/aliases.
