==Usage== <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
# Select a previously created [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipeline]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_PostFilterContours.svg|16px]] [[FEM_PostFilterContours|Contours Filter]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Results → [[Image:FEM_PostFilterContours.svg|16px]] Contours Filter}} option from the menu.
# Adjust the {{MenuCommand|Result display options}} like for the [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|result pipeline]]. You might need to hide the pipeline to see the effect of the filter in the preview.
# In the dialog that appears set the result field and the number of contours.
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button to finish the command.

==Options== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
The dialog offers the following settings:

<!--T:10-->
* '''Field''': The results field to be drawn.
* '''Vector''': If the '''Field''' is a vector, the vector components.
* '''Number of contours''': The number of contours to be created. '''Note:''' depending on the geometry the created number of contours can be higher than specified. This is caused by the creation algorithm. However, for 2D and simple 3D geometries, the number should be correct.
* '''Smoothing''': If checked, Laplacian smoothing filter is applied to the Contours filter to make the isosurfaces less coarse. {{Version|1.1}}
* '''Relaxation Factor''': Controls the level of smoothing via amount of vertex displacement (if smoothing is enabled). {{Version|1.1}}
* '''No color''': Don't apply a color to the contours.

<!--T:11-->
'''Note''': A '''Field''' can only be set if a filter function exists and has been applied with  [[Image:FEM_PostApplyChanges.svg|16px]] [[FEM_PostApplyChanges|Apply Changes]]. Alternatively you can reopen the filter dialog.

==File Size Information== <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
Setting a Contours filter can increase the file size significantly. The reason is that the algorithm needs to copy the [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|Post result pipeline]]. A single contour does not need the whole mesh and the algorithm only requires half the pipeline storage size to create a contour. But this will be the size increase for every contour. Take for example the case where the pipeline storage size is 1 MB, adding a Contours filter with 10 contours will then lead to a 5 MB larger file size.

<!--T:14-->
The storage size of the pipeline depends on the used mesh. The finer the mesh, the larger the pipeline size. Therefore be careful if you have large meshes and a large number of contours.

<!--T:15-->
If you use contours only on a part of the mesh, for example when you have a clip filter, then create the Contours filter on the filter and not on the pipeline. If you do need the whole pipeline, start with a few contours and then step by step go up until the file size is still acceptable while the visualization is as you like it.
