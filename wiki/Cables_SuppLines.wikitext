==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The [[File:Cables_SuppLines.svg|24px]] [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] is a dependent object and cannot be created directly.

<!--T:5-->
It can be created as a child object during creation of: [[Cables_CableBox|CableBox]], [[Cables_CableConnector|CableConnector]], [[Cables_ElectricalDevice|ElectricalDevice]], [[Cables_CableLightPoint|CableLightPoint]].

<!--T:6-->
It serves as a support for [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] objects which form a Base for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]]. The SuppLines object itself is attached to other objects mentioned above and keeps predefined placement relative to them. The SuppLines has a shape of a cross with five vertices which can be used as attachment supports for up to five cables entering single hole in a cable box. It can also be a reference point for cable entering the connector or electrical device. It is up to the user to find the SuppLines helpful or not.

<!--T:7-->
<u>Important:</u> the real relation between '''SuppLines''' object and its parent is reversed to avoid cyclic dependencies and to speed up recalculation. This has some consequences (see [[#Notes|Notes]]).

==Usage== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
The '''SuppLines''' object cannot be created directly. It is made during the creation of: [[Cables_CableBox|CableBox]], [[Cables_CableConnector|CableConnector]], [[Cables_ElectricalDevice|ElectricalDevice]], [[Cables_CableLightPoint|CableLightPoint]] depending on '''Number Of Supp Lines''' property of these objects.

==Notes== <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
* The '''SuppLines''' object has reversed relation with its parent to avoid cyclic dependencies. It is shown as a child in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] only for visual organization of objects. Undesirable consequence: when a parent is copied, all its child SuppLines objects must always be manually copied with it.
* Depending of parent the single '''SuppLines''' object can have one or more crosses.

==Properties== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
The '''SuppLines''' object has not any visible properties to edit. Its shape can be created and modified by its parent object or take the form of a cross with a default size.
