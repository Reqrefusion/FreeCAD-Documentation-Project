== Description == <!--T:3-->

The [[Image:BIM_Shape2DView.svg|24px]] [[BIM_Shape2DView|BIM Shape2DView]] tool creates a 2D projection of the selected objects on the XY-plane.

It is a specialized wrapper around the [[Draft_Shape2DView|Draft Shape2DView]] tool, tailored for architectural workflows. While the Draft tool keeps the 2D projection in its original 3D position by default, the BIM tool explicitly forces the {{PropertyData|InPlace}} property to {{FALSE}}. This strips the projection of its 3D spatial context, flattening it onto the global XY plane (at Z=0).

This behavior is specifically designed to work with an [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch SectionPlane]] to generate  2D architectural drawings (such as floor plans and elevations) that can be easily grouped in a [[BIM_DrawingView|BIM DrawingView]], exported to DXF/SVG, or inserted into a [[TechDraw_Workbench|TechDraw]] page. To generate the solid fills for intersected walls, use the companion [[BIM_Shape2DCut|BIM Shape2DCut]] tool.

For more info, see the [[Arch_SectionPlane#Typical_drawing_workflow|typical BIM drawing workflow]].

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

=== Projecting a Section Plane ===

This is the most common workflow for generating architectural views.

# Select an existing [[Arch_SectionPlane|Arch SectionPlane]] in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:BIM_Shape2DView.svg|16px]] [[BIM_Shape2DView|Section View]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Annotation → Create 2D Views → [[Image:BIM_Shape2DView.svg|16px]] Section View}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|V}} then {{KEY|V}}.
# A 2D projection of the objects seen by the section plane is created on the XY plane. The 3D camera orientation is ignored; the projection relies entirely on the section plane's direction.

=== Projecting a general object ===

# Rotate the 3D view so that you are looking at the object from the exact direction you want to project it. The camera direction will dictate the projection vector.
# Select one or more objects in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or the [[3D_view|3D view]].
# Invoke the tool as described above.
# A 2D projection of the selected objects is created on the XY plane.

== Options ==

The '''BIM Shape2DView''' tool produces a standard Draft Shape2DView object, but alters the following default property:
* {{PropertyData|InPlace|Bool}}: Set to {{FALSE}} so the projection is created flat on the XY plane instead of remaining in its 3D context.
