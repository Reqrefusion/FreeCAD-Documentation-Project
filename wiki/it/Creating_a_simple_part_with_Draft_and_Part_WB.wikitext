==Introduzione==

Questo tutorial si propone di essere utilizzato come prima introduzione all'[[Draft_Workbench/it|Ambiente Draft]] [[Image:Switch_DraftWorkbench.JPG]] di FreeCAD. Il tutorial utilizza una ''forma 2D'' per creare un ''solido 3D''; quest'ultimo viene realizzato tramite l'[[Part_Workbench/it|Ambiente Part]]. Si consiglia al lettore di leggere prima il tutorial gemello ''[[Creating_a_simple_part_with_Part_WB/it|Creazione di una parte semplice con Part]]'', che crea lo stesso modello con una tecnica diversa, coprendo allo stesso tempo le basi dell'interfaccia utente di FreeCAD. Questo tutorial prevede che l'utente abbia una minima familiarità sia con l'interfaccia utente che con alcuni flussi di lavoro disponibili in FreeCAD. Il tutorial è strutturato in modo tale che l'obiettivo non sia necessariamente quello di mostrare il modo più efficiente di utilizzare il programma, ma piuttosto quello di far conoscere al lettore le diverse funzionalità disponibili in FreeCAD, come utilizzarle e dove trovarle.

==La creazione del profilo 2D==

Creare un nuovo documento e salvarlo direttamente con un nuovo nome. Cambiare la vista in [[Image:Std_ViewTop.svg|24px|link=Std_ViewTop]] [[Std_ViewTop/it|Vista dall'alto]] e passare all'[[Draft_Workbench|Ambiente Draft]] [[Image:Workbench_Draft.svg|24px|link=Draft_Workbench]]; la schermata dovrebbe apparire come quella qui sotto. Se la griglia non viene visualizzata, attivarla/disattivarla con [[Image:Draft_ToggleGrid.svg|24px|link=Draft_ToggleGrid]] [[Draft_ToggleGrid/it|Attiva/disattiva griglia]].

[[Image:T101dwb01-01draftgrid.png|center]]

Per iniziare il profilo, disegnare un [[Image:Draft_Rectangle.svg|24px|link=Draft_Rectangle]] [[Draft_Rectangle/it|Rettangolo]] a caso sul piano xy cliccando su 2 punti nella [[3D_view/it|Vista 3D]] che formino una diagonale qualsiasi di un rettangolo. Una volta richiamato il comando, si aprirà un ''pannello Azioni''; in questo caso non verrà utilizzato, ma ovviamente si possono inserire direttamente le coordinate del rettangolo. La vista 3D dovrebbe ora presentare un rettangolo disegnato, simile a quello nell'immagine qui sotto.

[[Image:T101dwb01-02rectangleraw.png|center]]

Quando si lavora nell''''Ambiente Draft''', si disegna quasi sempre su un piano 2D. Questo piano 2D è chiamato ''[[Draft_SelectPlane/it|Piano di lavoro]]'' e, se si utilizzano le impostazioni predefinite, si allineerà sempre automaticamente alla vista 3D corrente. Pertanto, finché il profilo 2D non è completato, è meglio mantenere la vista dall'alto (posizione della telecamera) e non ruotarla. Se è stata modificata, è sufficiente tornare alla vista dall'alto prima di avviare qualsiasi nuovo comando nell''''Ambiente Draft'''.

La vista laterale del nostro modello finale ha un contorno esterno di 100 x 50 mm e sarebbe bello se l'angolo inferiore sinistro fosse posizionato nella posizione zero globale. Questo può essere fatto tramite l'''Editor proprietà''. Assicurarsi che il '''Rettangolo''' creato sia selezionato, quindi modificate la ''Posizione'' del rettangolo in '''(0, 0, 0)''', modificate l''altezza'' a '''50''' mm e la ''lunghezza'' a '''100''' mm come mostrato nelle immagini sottostanti.

[[Image:T101dwb01-03rectangleprops.png|center]]

The '''Rectangle''' is finished and it should look like this after applying [[Image:Std_ViewFitAll.svg|24px|link=Std_ViewFitAll]] [[Std_ViewFitAll|Fit all]] to the view.

[[Image:T101dwb01-04rectangledone.png|center]]

Next we will break up the rectangle into its four edges, this is done by first selecting the '''Rectangle''' and then invoking the command [[Image:Draft_Downgrade.svg|24px|link=Draft_Downgrade]] [[Draft_Downgrade|Draft Downgrade]], the filled face will disappear and the object in the ''Tree View'' is now a '''Wire''' instead of a '''Rectangle''', shown in the left picture below. Invoking '''Draft Downgrade''' once more will break up the ''wire'' into its ''edges'', shown in the middle picture below.

[[Image:T101dwb01-05rectangledowngrade.png|center]]

The observant will notice that the object icon in the Tree View already for the wire changed to a ''blue box''. This blue box is the icon used for generic geometric objects (Part Workbench geometric objects to be specific, but that is for advanced readers). Select the left vertical edge and invoke the command [[Image:Draft_Upgrade.svg|24px|link=Draft_Upgrade]] [[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]], the former ''edge'' will now have a different icon and has changed ''label'' to '''Line'''. It is now a '''Draft Workbench''' object where one can edit for example the ''start point'' and the ''end point'' through the ''Property editor'', this is not possible with the ''edge'' objects.

<span id="Creating_the_fillet"></span>
===La creazione del raccordo===

Start by selecting the upper right corner edges, use menu {{MenuCommand|Edit → Box selection}} [[Image:Std_BoxSelection.svg|24px|link=Std_BoxSelection]] [[Std_BoxSelection|Box selection]], hold down the [[Image:Mouse_LMB.svg|24px]] '''Left Mouse Button''' and drag ''from right to left'' and release the '''LMB'''. When dragging ''from right to left'' the resulting selection includes everything fully or partially within the selection area. If one drags ''from left to right'', only objects fully enclosed by the selection area are included in the resulting selection. The actual selection happens when the left mouse button is released, and there is no preview of what will be selected.

[[Image:T101dwb02-01filletboxselection.png|center]]

With the top right corner edges selected, invoke the command [[Image:Draft_Fillet.svg|24px|link=Draft_Fillet]] [[Draft_Fillet|Fillet]] in the '''Draft Workbench'''. Check ''Delete original objects'' and change the ''radius'' to 20 mm and hit {{KEY|enter}}.

[[Image:T101dwb02-02fillettaskpanel.png|center]]

The '''Fillet''' is created and your model should now look like below.

[[Image:T101dwb02-03filletdone.png|center]]

<span id="Creating_the_chamfer"></span>
===La creazione dello smusso===

To make the ''chamfer'' we need to have a line with the correct inclination and also be able to position it correctly. Let us begin with the position, which is on coordinate ''(50, 50, 0)''. In the current profile we do not have a point there, so let’s create one by making a ''temporary help line''. First select the left vertical '''Line''', then create the help line by [[Image:Std_DuplicateSelection.svg|24px|link=Std_DuplicateSelection]] [[Std_DuplicateSelection|Duplicate selection]] in {{MenuCommand|Edit → Duplicate selection}}, '''Line001''' is created. Use the ''Property editor'' and move '''Line001''' 50 mm in x-direction using the ''Placement'' property. Next duplicate the ''lower horizontal edge'', and change the ''angle'' of the edge to 30 degrees, once again using the ''Placement'' property. The model should now look like the image below.

[[Image:T101dwb03-01chamferhelp.png|center]]

Next, move the ''angled line'' into position. For this we make use of [[Image:Draft_Move.svg|24px|link=Draft_Move]] [[Draft_Move|Draft Move]] along with the ''snap'' functionality in the '''Draft Workbench''', more specifically ''end point'' snap. First make sure that your snap toolbar looks similar to below.

[[Image:T101pwb03-02_snap.png|center]]

Then select the ''angled line'', '''Edge001''', press '''Move''' and a ''task panel'' opens up.

[[Image:T101dwb03-03_movetaskpanel.png|center]]

Make sure that ''Copy'' is unchecked. Hover the mouse over the ''upper quarter'' of the ''angled line'', once the ''white dot'' is displayed at the right spot and the ''end point'' symbol shows, click the [[Image:Mouse_LMB.svg|24px]] '''LMB'''. Move the mouse to the upper quarter of the help line, once the white dot and end point symbol appear, click the '''LMB'''. The sequence is illustrated below.

[[Image:T101dwb03-04_moveline.png|center]]

The line is now in the correct position, but it is too long. To adjust the length [[Image:Draft_Trimex.svg|24px|link=Draft_Trimex]] [[Draft_Trimex|Draft Trimex]] will be used. Select the ''angled line'', '''Edge001''', press Trim and then click on the lower part of the ''left-most vertical line'', '''Line''', to use it as the cutting edge. The projection of the point where the cutting edge is selected onto the edge to be cut, determines the result. If you select the left-most vertical line near its top end, the wrong part of the angled line would be trimmed. The image below shows the '''Trim''' command invoked, the pre-selected vertical line, and the cursor hovering over the wrong end of that line. If you look carefully you can see the preview of the result.

[[Image:T101dwb03-05_trimline.png|center]]

Also trim the left-most vertical line to form the lower corner of the chamfer. Select the ''angled line'', '''Edge001''', near its top right endpoint for a correct result. If you make a mistake while trimming, just use [[Image:Std_Undo.svg|24px|link=Std_Undo]] [[Std_Undo|Undo]] and [[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px|link=Std_Refresh]] [[Std_Refresh|Refresh]] (the latter often called ''recompute'') and try again.

[[Image:T101dwb03-06_chamferlowercornerdone.png|center]]

To trim the ''upper horizontal edge'', the '''Fillet''' needs to be ''downgraded'' so that the upper edge is its own object in the Tree View. If you attempt to trim it without first having done the downgrade, the trimming function attempts to trim the arc in the fillet. Because the trimming edge, the ''middle vertical line'', is perpendicular to the edge to be trimmed, you cannot control the trim result by picking a correct point on the trimming edge. Here you need the flip the default solution by holding down the {{KEY|Alt}} key as you select the cutting edge.

The profile is ready and shown below with the edges organized in a [[Image:Std_Group.svg|24px|link=Std_Group]] [[Std_Group|Group]] named '''Profile''' (or ''labeled'' to be precise in FreeCAD lingo), along with the help line deleted. Groups can be used to organize the features in your ''FreeCAD documents'', its usage is similar to a folder structure on a computer’s file system. To move things in and out of the group, use ''drag and drop'' in the Tree View.

[[Image:T101dwb03-07_profiledone.png|center]]

<span id="Why_extruding_can_fail"></span>
==Perchè l'estruzione potrebbe fallire==

Save the document. We will experiment in this paragraph and we want to be able to go back to the current model.

Let’s jump right in: select all the edges and the line in the ''group'' '''Profile''', and in the [[Image:Workbench_Part.svg|24px|link=Part_Workbench]] [[Part_Workbench|Part Workbench]] invoke the command [[Image:Part_Extrude.svg|24px|link=Part_Extrude]] [[Part_Extrude|Extrude]]. A ''task panel'' opens, accept all the defaults and click {{Button|OK}}.

[[Image:T101dwb04-01_extrudelineserror.png|center]]

That did not work out, but it sounds easy enough to fix the error, we just need to specify a direction. Click {{Button|OK}} to get back to the ''task panel'' and select ''custom direction''.

[[Image:T101dwb04-02_extrudelineszaxis.png|center]]

Accept the default z-axis and once more click {{Button|OK}}.

[[Image:T101dwb04-03_extrudelinessheets.png|center]]

We managed to make a fence like structure, judging from the Tree View every edge is treated separately. It is not the filled solid that we want. Hit [[Std_Undo|Undo]], and let’s try something else.

Scrolling all the way to the bottom of the '''Extrude''' ''task panel'' there is an option ''Create solid'', check that option and click {{Button|OK}}.

[[Image:T101dwb04-04_extrudelinesfilled.png|center]]

Everything disappeared, clearly that did not work either. Let’s go through why none of these ways are working. In the first case we got an error that the direction could not be determined. A flat face has a normal, i.e. direction, a line does not. Since from our second attempt we know that it worked when providing a direction, the error simply comes from trying to extrude a line without knowing a direction. The observant will say that an arc has a normal (direction), this is true. If you select only the edge that is the arc, FreeCAD will extrude it, also with default settings.

In the second case it worked, but we also got an extrusion for each edge we had in our selection. The resulting features however are not what we want, i.e. a solid.

In the third case we checked ''Create solid'', and ended up with everything disappearing. The objects in the Tree View have a different icon as well, there is a ''white exclamation'' mark on a red background, that particular ''overlay icon'' means that the object has an error that has to be tended to. One can read up on the different types of [[Tree_view#Overlay_icons|overlay icons]] on the wiki. 

Hovering over any of the Tree View objects with the overlay icon a tool tip is displayed, it says ''Wire is not closed''.

[[Image:T101dwb04-05_extrudelineserrortooltip.png|center]]

In our case the error is not fixable. It is ''geometrically impossible'' to create a solid out of an extruded single line. An extruded line simply becomes a sheet, or ''shell'' in FreeCAD lingo. In other words, this is not a FreeCAD limitation, it is a fundamental outcome of geometrical theory. The reason why the 3D view goes completely blank is that the created features, or objects in the Tree View, have errors in the produced ''shape'', and thus contain nothing to render. FreeCAD does however create the new document objects (in this case extrusions) and thus hides any geometry/object used for making the new document objects. That is why the screen goes blank when trying to make a solid out of a line, or lines.

The tool tip says it all, in order to extrude into a solid one needs a ''closed wire, or a face''. A face is, per definition, simply a closed wire that is filled. One way to create a closed wire out of our profile edges is to select them all and apply [[Image:Draft_Upgrade.svg|24px|link=Draft_Upgrade]] [[Draft_Upgrade|Draft Upgrade]]. If applied once it becomes a wire, while at the same time it consumes the individual edges from the Tree View. If applied twice it becomes a face, either of those allows for a successful solid extrusion.

Before going on to the next paragraph: open the previous version of the document.

<span id="Extruding_the_profile"></span>
==Estrusione del profilo==

Another way to create the closed wire is with the [[Image:Part_Builder.svg|24px|link=Part_Builder]] [[Part_Builder|Shape builder]] command from the Part Workbench, which allows for making a wire without consuming the individual edges. '''Part Shape builder''' is a powerful tool to create any geometric entity in FreeCAD that can be used further to create complex solids, the simplest example is creating a line between two vertices. Click '''Part Shape builder''' to bring up the ''task panel''.

[[Image:T101dwb05-01_shapebuildertaskpanel.png|center]]

We can use either ''Wire from edges'' or ''Face from edges''. Multiple selections have to be made with the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key pressed down. Let’s use ''Face from edges'', once that option is selected one can also select ''Planar'', do that as well. Then select all edges in the profile, the order does not matter (in this case) and click {{Button|Create}}, and then {{Button|Close}} to come back to the Tree View. The ''face'' has been created.

[[Image:T101dwb05-02_shapebuilderfacedone.png|center]]

Select the '''Face''' and invoke '''Part Extrude''', set the extrusion ''length'' to '''30''' mm and click {{Button|OK}}.

[[Image:T101dwb05-03_extrusiondone.png|center]]

<span id="Creating_the_through_hole"></span>
==Creazione del foro passante==

To make the through hole we need a ''cylinder'' correctly ''positioned'' to make a boolean ''cut'' with.

Create a cylinder, and position it correctly. In this case the ''radius'' is 5 mm, the ''height'' is set to 60 mm. For the placement, first it is ''rotated'' -90 degrees around the x-axis, then positioned at ''(65, -5, 15)''. The negative 5 in the y-direction is because the height is 10 mm longer than needed.

[[Image:T101dwb05-04_cylinderplaced.png|center]]

It does not hurt to make the height of the cylinder longer than needed. For a simple model like this it will not matter if the cylinder is the exact height of the profile. It is however good practice to avoid co-planar faces to prevent numerical errors in the geometric kernel that can sometimes result in strange effects, or failures in subsequent operations.

With a final boolean cut, and after changing the appearance of the resulting object, the model is completed.

[[Image:T101dwb05-05_modelcomplete.png|center]]

<span id="Making_a_sketch_out_of_the_2D_profile"></span>
==Creazione di uno schizzo del profilo 2D==

Using the '''Draft Workbench''' is one way of creating a 2D profile. In the '''Draft Workbench''' a wire can be made in 3D space. FreeCAD provides another tool to make 2D profiles – the [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|24px|link=Sketcher_Workbench]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]]. Using a ''sketch'' is a more versatile way to create a 2D profile. Any 2D profile made in the '''Draft Workbench''' can be converted to an ''unconstrained'' sketch.

Start by hiding the '''Cut''' feature and make the edges and the line in the profile visible. Select the edges and the line and from the '''Draft Workbench''' press the toolbar button [[Image:Draft_Draft2Sketch.svg|24px|link=Draft_Draft2Sketch]] [[Draft_Draft2Sketch|Draft to Sketch]]. You should see the same as in the image below.

[[Image:T101dwb06-01_draft2sketch.png|center]]

Next, hide the original edges and double-click the '''Sketch''' object in the Tree View, bringing you to the following state, i.e. the ''Sketcher task panel'' opened.

[[Image:T101dwb06-02_sketchedit.png|center]]

This is how it looks when one ''edits a sketch''. Since this is not a tutorial for using the Sketcher just go ahead and close it. If you want an introduction to sketching, which is a core workflow in any 3D parametric CAD, please follow the sister tutorial ''[[Creating_a_simple_part_with_PartDesign|Creating a simple part with PartDesign]]''.

With the '''Sketch''' closed and selected, from the '''Part Workbench''' use Extrude in the same way as before. The basic block of the simple model is ready once again.

[[Image:T101dwb06-03_sketchextruded.png|center]]

<span id="Quality_of_models"></span>
==Qualità dei modelli==

Sooner or later when working with 3D parametric CAD you will come across a broken model, either one you have made yourself, or a model that you have imported. A broken model can work for its purpose, but more often than not, there are subsequent operations that simply will not work. To repair a broken model one has to know what to repair, this is where the built-in quality check tools in FreeCAD come in.

First let us check the quality of the recently created '''Extrude001'''. With the '''Part Workbench''' active, first select '''Extrude001''' and then use the command [[Image:Part_CheckGeometry.svg|24px|link=Part_CheckGeometry]] [[Part_CheckGeometry|Check geometry]]. Check all settings checkboxes except the top one, and click the {{Button|Run check}} button.

[[Image:T101dwb07-01_geocheck.png|center]]

Our model is OK, no errors are reported. There is also a listing of the models content, or in FreeCAD lingo, the content of the ''shape'', i.e. how it is put together from ground up. Here one can see that apparently to make a ''solid'' one also needs a ''shell'', and the shell is made out of ''faces'', and so on. In other words, you can create any solid by simply starting out by making points, or ''vertices'', from those one makes ''edges'', and from those one creates ''wires'', and out of the wires one makes ''faces'' which are then stitched into a ''shell'', from which one finally arrives at a ''solid''. A solid can only be made from a watertight shell. A not watertight shell is a common source of troublesome CAD models, it can for example happen with imported geometry created in a different software, especially when using the commonly available neutral file formats.

Another check one can do is related to the '''Sketch'''. Close the ''task panel'' for the geometry check. Select the '''Sketch''', expand '''Extrude001''' in the Tree View if needed in order to see the sketch object. Switch to the [[Image:Workbench_Sketcher.svg|24px|link=Sketcher_Workbench]] [[Sketcher_Workbench|Sketcher Workbench]], use the command [[Image:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|24px|link=Sketcher_ValidateSketch]] [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Validate sketch]], a ''task panel'' opens. In the ''task panel'', click the {{Button|Find}} button for ''Missing coincidences''. It highlights and reports ''6'' of them, i.e. all the points where the edges meet.

[[Image:T101dwb07-02_sketchvalidate.png|center]]

Click {{Button|OK}} in the pop-up dialog and then click the {{Button|Fix}} button to heal the ''Missing coincidences''. If you close the ''task panel'', and go into ''edit mode'' of the '''Sketch''', it reports ''12 degrees of freedom'', as opposed to the earlier ''24''. That was achieved through adding ''coincident constraints'' to the endpoints of the edges.

The observant reader notices that when using edges from Draft those had to be joined into a closed wire to make a solid extrusion, whereas in Sketcher that was apparently not needed. The logic here is that the sketch is one object, and the extrusion of one object is treated as if it was a closed wire (in this case).

Finally it should be pointed out that, although creating subsequent objects from sketches with ''open vertices'' can work, it is ''best practice'' to ''not have any'', as well as to have a ''fully constrained sketch'' (as opposed to an under-constrained sketch). The reason why it works here is that the ''sketch'' is created from a Draft profile constructed in such a way that the endpoints of the edges match without any gaps. If you draw by hand in a sketch, and also try to match endpoints by hand, it is virtually guaranteed that endpoints will not match, i.e. the gaps (although not really visible on the screen) will be large enough that the geometric kernel cannot consider the edges to be geometrically joined.

<span id="Wrapping_up"></span>
==Concludendo==

Having gone through the tutorial you have become somewhat familiar with the basic functionality of FreeCAD, along with the core workbenches '''Part''' and '''Draft'''. You are also aware of the existence of the '''Sketcher Workbench''', which for many experienced users is the sole tool used to create 2D profiles later utilized in solid feature operations. The use of ''sketches'' is a core concept in the '''PartDesign Workbench'''. It is suggested that you learn ''sketches'' and '''PartDesign Workbench''' next if your focus is on creating solids. The sister-tutorial ''[[Creating_a_simple_part_with_PartDesign|Creating a simple part with PartDesign]]'' makes the same model as this tutorial. If your focus is modeling buildings your next learning should be the '''Draft''' and '''Arch''' workbenches.

At last, FreeCAD is made by volunteers in their spare time. If you want to further advance FreeCAD’s capabilities, consider [[Help_FreeCAD|contributing]] to FreeCAD, for example by improving the documentation.
