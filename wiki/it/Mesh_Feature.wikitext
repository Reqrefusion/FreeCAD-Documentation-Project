A [[Mesh Feature|Mesh Feature]] object, or formally a {{incode|Mesh::Feature}}, is a simple element with an associated [[Mesh_MeshObject|mesh object]] that can be displayed in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

A Mesh Feature is similar conceptually to a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]]; the former is the base object for elements with "mesh" information, while the latter is the base object for elements with "geometrical shape" information.

Please note that the [[FEM_Workbench|FEM Workbench]] also uses meshes, but it uses a different object, called [[FEM_Mesh|FEM FemMeshObject]] ({{incode|Fem::FemMeshObject}} class). This object is not derived from the Mesh Feature and has different properties.

==Utilizzo==

Almost all mesh objects created by the commands available in the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] are [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Features]]. The parametric mesh objects created by the [[Mesh_BuildRegularSolid|Mesh BuildRegularSolid]] command are the only exception. A [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] can also be created from the [[Python_console|Python console]] as described in the [[#Scripting|Scripting]] section.

The {{incode|Mesh::Feature}} is defined in the [[Mesh_Workbench|Mesh Workbench]] but can be used as the base class for [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]] in all [[Workbenches|workbenches]] that produce 2D and 3D meshes.

A {{incode|Mesh::Feature}} has simple properties like a [[Placement|placement]], and visual properties to define the appearance of its edges and faces.

== Properties ==

See [[Property|Property]] for all property types that scripted objects can have.

The [[Mesh_Feature|Mesh Feature]] ({{incode|Mesh::Feature}} class) is derived from the basic [[App_GeoFeature|App GeoFeature]] ({{incode|App::GeoFeature}} class) and inherits all its properties. It also has several additional properties. Notably a {{PropertyData|Mesh}} property, which stores its [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]]. This is the geometry that is shown in the [[3D_view|3D view]].

These are the properties available in the [[Property_editor|property editor]]. Hidden properties can be shown by using the {{MenuCommand|Show hidden}} command in the context menu of the [[Property_editor|property editor]].

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyData|Proxy|PythonObject|Hidden}}: a custom class associated with this object. This only exists for the [[Python|Python]] version. See [[#Scripting|Scripting]].
* {{PropertyData|Mesh|MeshKernel}}: a [[Mesh_MeshObject|Mesh MeshObject]] class associated with this object. It lists the number of {{Value|Points}}, {{Value|Edges}}, and {{Value|Faces}} of the mesh.
* {{PropertyData|Placement|Placement}}: the position of the object in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. The placement is defined by a {{incode|Base}} point (vector), and a {{incode|Rotation}} (axis and angle). See [[Placement|Placement]].
** {{PropertyData|Angle}}: the angle of rotation around the {{PropertyData|Axis}}. By default, it is {{value|0°}} (zero degrees).
** {{PropertyData|Axis}}: the unit vector that defines the axis of rotation for the placement. Each component is a floating point value between {{value|0}} and {{value|1}}. If any value is above {{value|1}}, the vector is normalized so that the magnitude of the vector is {{value|1}}. By default, it is the positive Z axis, {{value|(0, 0, 1)}}.
** {{PropertyData|Position}}: a vector with the 3D coordinates of the base point. By default, it is the origin {{value|(0, 0, 0)}}.
* {{PropertyData|Label|String}}: the user editable name of this object, it is an arbitrary UTF8 string.
* {{PropertyData|Label2|String|Hidden}}: a longer, user editable description of this object, it is an arbitrary UTF8 string that may include newlines. By default, it is an empty string {{value|""}}.
* {{PropertyData|Expression Engine|ExpressionEngine|Hidden}}: a list of expressions. By default, it is empty {{value|[]}}.
* {{PropertyData|Visibility|Bool|Hidden}}: whether to display the object or not.

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Base}}

* {{PropertyView|Proxy|PythonObject|Hidden}}: a custom [[Viewprovider|viewprovider]] class associated with this object. This only exists for the [[Python|Python]] version. See [[#Scripting|Scripting]].

{{TitleProperty|Display Options}}

* {{PropertyView|Bounding Box|Bool}}: if it is {{TRUE}}, the object will show the bounding box in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
* {{PropertyView|Display Mode|Enumeration}}: {{value|Shaded}} (no edges), {{value|Wireframe}} (no faces), {{value|Flat Lines}} (regular visualization), {{value|Points}} (only vertices).
* {{PropertyView|Show In Tree|Bool}}: if it is {{TRUE}}, the object appears in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]]. Otherwise, it is set as invisible.
* {{PropertyView|Visibility|Bool}}: if it is {{TRUE}}, the object appears in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; otherwise it is invisible. By default this property can be toggled on and off by pressing the {{KEY|Space}} bar.

{{TitleProperty|Object Style}}

* {{PropertyView|Coloring|Bool|Hidden}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyView|Crease Angle|FloatConstraint}}:
* {{PropertyView|Lighting|Enumeration}}: {{value|One side}} (default), {{value|Two side}}; the illumination comes from two sides or one side in the [[3D_view|3D view]].
* {{PropertyView|Line Color|Color}}: a tuple of three floating point RGB values {{value|(r,g,b)}} to define the color of the edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; by default it is {{value|(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)}}, which is displayed as {{value|[0,0,0]}} on base 255, <span style="background-color:#000; color:#eee; width:3em; height:12pt; padding: 2px 1em 2px;">completely black </span>.
* {{PropertyView|Line Transparency|Percent}}: an integer from {{value|0}} to {{value|100}} (a percentage) that determines the level of transparency of the edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. A value of {{value|100}} indicates completely invisible edges; the edges are invisible but they can still be picked as long as {{PropertyView|Selectable}} is {{TRUE}}.
* {{PropertyView|Line Width|FloatConstraint}}: a float that determines the width in pixels of the edges in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. It defaults to {{value|1.0}}.
* {{PropertyView|Open Edges|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}.
* {{PropertyView|Point Size|FloatConstraint}}: similar to {{PropertyView|Line Width}}, defines the size of the vertices.
* {{PropertyView|Shape Color|Color}}: similar to {{PropertyView|Line Color}}, defines the color of the faces. It defaults to {{value|(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)}}, which is displayed as {{value|[204,204,204]}} on base 255, a <span style="background-color:#ccc; width:3em; height:12pt; padding: 2px 1em 2px;">light gray</span>.
* {{PropertyView|Shape Material|Material|Hidden}}: an [[App_Material|App Material]] associated with this object. By default it is empty.
* {{PropertyView|Transparency|Percent}}: an integer from {{value|0}} to {{value|100}} (a percentage) that determines the level of transparency of the faces in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. A value of {{value|100}} indicates completely invisible faces; the faces are invisible but they can still be picked as long as {{PropertyView|Selectable}} is {{TRUE}}.

{{TitleProperty|Selection}}

* {{PropertyView|On Top When Selected|Enumeration}}: {{value|Disabled}} (default), {{value|Enabled}}, {{value|Object}}, {{value|Element}}.
* {{PropertyView|Selectable|Bool}}: if it is {{TRUE}}, the object can be picked with the pointer in the [[3D_view|3D view]]. Otherwise, the object cannot be selected until this option is set to {{TRUE}}.
* {{PropertyView|Selection Style|Enumeration}}: {{value|Shape}} (default), {{value|BoundBox}}. If the option is {{value|Shape}}, the entire shape (vertices, edges, and faces) will be highlighted in the [[3D_view|3D view]]; if it is {{value|BoundBox}} only the bounding box will be highlighted.

== Scripting ==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]] and [[Scripted_objects|scripted objects]].

See [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] for the general information on adding objects to the document.

A Mesh Feature is created with the {{incode|addObject()}} method of the document.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Mesh::Feature", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}

For [[Python|Python]] subclassing you should create the {{incode|Mesh::FeaturePython}} object.

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.newDocument()
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Mesh::FeaturePython", "Name")
obj.Label = "Custom label"
}}
