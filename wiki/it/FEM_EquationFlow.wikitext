==Description==

Da fare

For info about the math of the equation, see the [https://www.elmerfem.org/blog/documentation/ Elmer models manual], section ''Navier-Stokes Equations''.

==Usage==

# Add an [[Image:FEM_SolverElmer.svg|16px|link=FEM_SolverElmer#Equations]] [[FEM_SolverElmer#Equations|Elmer solver]].
# Select it in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_EquationFlow.svg|16px]] [[FEM_EquationFlow|Flow equation]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Solve → [[Image:FEM_EquationFlow.svg|24px]] Flow equation}} option from the menu.
# Change the [[#Solver_Settings|equation's solver settings]] or the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|general solver settings]] if necessary.

==Solver Settings==

For the general solver settings, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|Elmer solver settings]].

The flow equation provides these special settings:
* {{PropertyData|Div Discretization}}: To be set to ''true'' for incompressible flow for more stable discretization when the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number Reynolds number] increases.
* {{PropertyData|Flow Model}}: The flow model that should be used. The default ''Full'' includes convection and time derivative terms in the model. ''No convection'' switches off the convection terms and the ''Stokes'' model switches off the convection terms and the (explicit) time derivative terms.
* {{PropertyData|Gradp Discretization}}: If set to ''true'' pressure [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition Dirichlet boundary conditions] can be used. Also the mass flux is available as a natural boundary condition.
* {{PropertyData|Variable}}: Optional only for calculations in 2D: You can change the default of ''3'' to ''2''.</br>'''Note''': In this case none of the flow velocity boundary conditions can have a specified z-component.

Equation:
* {{PropertyData|Convection}}: The type of convection to be used in the [[Image:FEM_EquationHeat.svg|24px]] [[FEM_EquationHeat|Heat equation]].</br>'''Note''': For thermal flows it must be set to ''Computed'' (the default).
* {{PropertyData|Magnetic Induction}}: If set to ''true'' the magnetic induction equation will be solved along with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations Navier-Stokes equations].

===Notes for Convergence===

If the solver results do not converge, you can try these things (in the given order):
# Reduce the {{PropertyData|Relaxation Factor}}, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Relaxation_Factor|nonlinear system settings]].
# Increase the value for {{PropertyData|Nonlinear Newton After Iterations}}, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Nonlinear_System|nonlinear system settings]].
# Reduce the number of CPU cores used, see the [[FEM_Preferences#Elmer|FEM preferences]].
# Increase the mesh density (make it more fine).

==Analysis Feature Information==

The flow equation takes the following analysis features into account if they are set:

* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity|Flow velocity boundary condition]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity|Initial flow velocity condition]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg|32px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure|Initial pressure condition]] ({{Version|0.21}})

===Notes===

* Except for calculations in 2D, for all above boundary conditions it is important that they act on a face or body. Boundary conditions for 3D set to lines or vertices are not recognized by the Elmer solver.
* Since [[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]] can only be set to faces, pressure loads cannot be used for calculations in 2D.
* If there is no [[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]] set, [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure|Initial pressure condition]] will only be taken into account if {{PropertyData|Gradp Discretization}} is set to ''true''.

==Results==

The results are the velocity in <math>\rm m/s</math>  and the pressure in <math>\rm Pa</math>. If there is no [[Image:FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure|Initial pressure condition]] and [[Image:FEM_ConstraintPressure.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]] given, the resulting pressure will be relative not absolute. Since pressure must act on a face, absolute pressure results cannot be obtained in 2D simulations.
