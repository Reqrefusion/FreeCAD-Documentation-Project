==Description==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|24px]] [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]] object is derived from [[Image:Draft_Wire.svg|24px]] [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] and inherits all its properties. The main difference is that WireFlex is able to attach every of its vertexes to external vertex or object (attachment to object is understood as an attachment to its Placement.Base). Not every vertex has to be attached, some of them can be left to move freely depending on current needs. Another difference is that the '''WireFlex''' can take on three different shapes (see [[#Path Type Property|Path Type Proterty]]).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Main purpose of a '''WireFlex''' is to serve as a base for a [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or a [[Cables_CableConduit|Cable Conduit]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
All WireFlex vertexes can be edited like '''Draft Wire''' vertexes with the [[Cables_Edit|Cables Edit]] command (just double-click on the WireFlex in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]]). See [[#Notes|Notes]].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Some properties of WireFlex inherited from '''Draft Wire''' are hidden by default, some of them like '''Fillet Radius''' can be controlled from the cable properties if WireFlex is a base of a [[Cables_Cable|Cable]]. From version 0.2.0 onward the following restriction has been removed: in version 0.1.4 and earlier it was strongly recommended to set Fillet Radius as the last step of WireFlex creation. Setting this during WireFlex editing could lead to an error: "''Not possible to modify WireFlex due to non zero Chamfer or Fillet or Subdivision''".

===Path Type Property===
(property introduced in version 0.2.0)
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
WireFlex object can take on three different shapes based on the same '''Points''' property. These are: Wire, B-spline-K, B-spline-P. For a Wire shape the '''Points''' serve as vertices, for a B-spline-K shape the '''Points''' are mapped as knots (like in [[Draft_BSpline|Draft BSpline]]) and for a B-spline-P shape the '''Points''' act as poles (similar to [[Draft_BezCurve|Draft BezCurve]], a B-spline-P is smoother then and easier to control than a B-spline-K).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Curves such as B-spline-K and B-spline-P do not officially exist. Both refer to the B-spline curve. These names were introduced here to distinguish how these two curves are created, resulting in different shapes.

===Colors of Vertexes===
(feature introduced in version 0.2.0)

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
By default points representing WireFlex vertexes can have the following colors:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:Cables_WireFlex_Vertex_Normal.png|30px]] for regular vertex which can be freely moved,
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:Cables_WireFlex_Vertex_Attached1.png|30px]] or [[File:Cables_WireFlex_Vertex_Attached2.png|30px]] for attached vertex (see [[Cables_AttachVertex|Attach Vertex]] for details),
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
If necessary, the above colors can be changed (see View Properties).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
==Usage==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Select the first external existing vertex in the [[3D_View|3D View]]
# Select additional vertexes (one or more) in the [[3D_View|3D View]] holding the {{KEY|CTRL}} key.
# It is also acceptable to select nothing, then the default wire with 5cm length will be created (<span style="color:blue;">introduced in version 0.3.0</span>).
# Create '''WireFlex''' by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|16px]] [[Cables_WireFlex|WireFlex]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|16px]] WireFlex}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cable Wires → [[Image:Cables_WireFlex.svg|16px]] WireFlex}} option from the context menu.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Note1: selection of elements other than vertexes is treated as a selection of entire object. In this case the Placement.Base of a selected object is taken as a reference.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Note2: If only one vertex|entire object is selected, then created WireFlex will be built from the Points property of selected object and no vertex attachments are made. If selected object has no Points property, the creation is made from the vertexes of selected object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
After wire creation the first vertex|object which was selected in 3D View is automatically added to Attachment Support of a wire and the Map Mode property is set to Translate origin (general description of part attachment is here: [[Part_EditAttachment|Part EditAttachment]]). Additionally the same vertex|object is added to Vrtx_start property, the last selected vertex|object is added to Vrtx_end property and the selected mid vertexes|objects are added to Vrtxs_mid and Vrtxs_mid_idx accordingly.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
At any time any WireFlex vertex can be detached or reatached to other object by using [[Image:Cables_AttachVertex.svg|24px]] [[Cables_AttachVertex|Attach Vertex]] or [[Image:Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg|24px]] [[Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment|Remove Vertex Attachment]] tools (or by using [[Image:Cables_Edit.svg|24px]] [[Cables_Edit|Cables Edit]] command).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
It is advised to experiment and familiarize yourself with the various options for possibly moving objects attached to a wire and observe the behavior of the wire depending on how many and which vertexes are attached to external objects and whether the Map Mode property is enabled or disabled for the entire wire. Even more interesting possibilities are provided by using e.g. [[Image:Cables_SupportLine.svg|24px]] [[Cables_SupportLine|Support Line]] or [[Image:Cables_SupportPoint.svg|24px]] [[Cables_SupportPoint|Support Point]].

* A '''WireFlex''' can be edited with the [[Cables_Edit|Cables Edit]] command (run by double-click on the WireFlex in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]]) (introduced in version 0.2.0). Do not use [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] due to the restrictions described below.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
In version 0.1.4 and earlier [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] was used with the following restrictions:
When in '''Draft Edit''' mode DO NOT use "Add point" and "Delete point" from context menu. This can lead to wrong assignment of points attachments. To add or delete point from '''WireFlex''' use only [[Image:Cables_AddVertex.svg|24px]] [[Cables_AddVertex|Add Vertex]] or [[Image:Cables_DelVertex.svg|24px]] [[Cables_DelVertex|Delete Vertex]] while not in '''Draft Edit''' mode.

* {{PropertyData|Fillet Radius|Length}}: specifies the radius of the fillets at the corners of the wire. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|Wire}}.
* {{PropertyData|Length|Length}}: (read-only) specifies the total length of the wire.
* {{PropertyData|Path Type|Enumeration}}: specifies the type of the wire shape (introduced in version 0.2.0). Possible values: {{Value|Wire}}, {{Value|BSpline_K}}, {{Value|BSpline_P}}
* {{PropertyData|Boundary Segment Start|Length}}: specifies the length of a straight edge at the beginning of a wire. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_P}} or {{Value|BSpline_K}}. It can be used when beginning of a cable sits inside a connector or if a straight part of BSpline wire is needed. Its value is represented in 3D View as a boundary vertex with a special color. This vertex cannot be attached to other objects. It is recommended to leave the value of this property > 0 if the WireFlex is used as a base for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or [[Cables_CableConduit|Cable Conduit]].
* {{PropertyData|Boundary Segment End|Length}}: specifies the length of a straight edge at the end of a wire. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_P}} or {{Value|BSpline_K}}. It can be used when end of a cable sits inside a connector or if straight part of BSpline wire is needed. Its value is represented in 3D View as a boundary vertex with a special color. This vertex cannot be attached to other objects. It is recommended to leave the value of this property > 0 if the WireFlex is used as a base for [[Cables_Cable|Cable]] or [[Cables_CableConduit|Cable Conduit]].
* {{PropertyData|Boundary Tangents|Bool}}: it specifies if the connections between the inner BSpline edge and boundary straight edges of a wire are tangent or not. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_K}}.
* {{PropertyData|Inner Tangents|Bool}}: it enables/disables usage of tangents on inner BSpline knots. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_K}}. When enabled, the BSpline is easier to control, otherwise it can be difficult to obtain desired shape, especially if '''Boundary Tangents''' are enabled.
* {{PropertyData|Parameterization|Float}}: affects the shape of the spline. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_K}}. Allowed range: [0.0, 3.0] (0 -> Uniform / 0.5 -> Centripetal / 1.0 -> Chord-Length). Same as in [[Draft_BSpline|Draft BSPline]].
* {{PropertyData|Tangency Coefficient|Float}}: it specifies if inner tangents form symmetric curves around knots (value = 0.5), bent toward start of spline (value < 0.5) or bent toward end of spline (value > 0.5). Allowed range: [0.0, 1.0]. It is valid and visible if '''Path Type''' = {{Value|BSpline_K}} and '''Inner Tangents''' enabled.
