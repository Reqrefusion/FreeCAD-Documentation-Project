==Esempio==

B-splines are basically a combination of [[B-Splines#B.C3.A9zier_curves|Bézier curves]] (nicely explained in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1MrrqBAl8 this] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXJylM2S72s this] video).

In this cubic B-spline (degree 3) there are 3 segments, meaning 3 curves are connected at 2 knots.

The degree is indicated by the number in the center. See [[File:Sketcher_BSplineDegree.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineDegree|Show/hide B-spline degree]].

{{Caption|B-spline with degree 3 and 2 knots that each have multiplicity 1.}}

The outer segments each have 2 control points, the inner segment has none to ensure the knots have multiplicity 1. See [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity#Description|this page]] for an explanation about multiplicity.

Increasing the degree to 4 will add control points without changing the shape of the B-spline:

{{Caption|Same B-spline where the degree was changed from 3 to 4. Note that the knot multiplicity has also increased.}}

From this result you cannot get back to the initial state of the B-spline by decreasing the degree. Some information is lost when the degree of a B-spline is changed. Decreasing the degree back to 3 leads to this:

{{Caption|Same B-spline where the degree was changed back from 4 to 3. Note that the knot multiplicity has increased again. Depending on the B-spline, the algorithm to decrease the degree may add a lot of knots to preserve the shape as has happened here.}}

Each segment now has 2 control points and each knot is coincident with an additional control point. The knots have ''C<sup>0</sup>'' continuity so that the B-spline will get "corners" if you move a control point. The information of a higher continuity is therefore lost. See [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity#Description|this page]] for an explanation about continuity.
