==Description==

This equation performs static current conduction analyses. It solves the electrostatic potential in a conducting medium allowing volume currents and electric power loss ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating Joule heating]) to be derived.

For info about the math of the equation, see the [http://www.elmerfem.org/blog/documentation/ Elmer models manual], section ''Static Current Conduction''.

==Usage==

# After adding an Elmer solver as described [[FEM_SolverElmer#Equations|here]], select it in the [[Tree_view|tree view]].
# Now either use the toolbar button [[Image:FEM_EquationStaticCurrent.svg|24px]] or the menu {{MenuCommand|Solve → Electromagnetic Equations → Static current equation}}.
# Change the [[#Solver_Settings|equation's solver settings]] or the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|general solver settings]] if necessary.

==Solver Settings==

For the general solver settings, see the [[FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings|Elmer solver settings]].

The static current equation provides these special settings:
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Joule Heating}}: Calculates the Joule heating.
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Nodal Heating}}: Calculates the nodal heating that can be used to couple the heat equation optimally when using conforming finite element meshes.
* {{PropertyData|Calculate Volume Current}}: Calculates the volume current.
* {{PropertyData|Constant Weights}}: Turns constant weighting on for the results.
* {{PropertyData|Current}}: Current control value.
* {{PropertyData|Current Control}}: Apply current control with the desired current.
* {{PropertyData|Heat Source}}: Use Joule heating as a heat source in combination with heat equation.
* {{PropertyData|Power}}: Power control value.
* {{PropertyData|Power Control}}: Apply power control with the desired heating power.

==Analysis Feature Information==

The static current equation takes the following analysis features into account if they are set:

* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential|Electrostatic potential boundary condition]]
* [[Image:FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity|Current density boundary condition]]

===Note===

Except for calculations in 2D, for [[Image:FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential.svg|24px]] [[FEM_ConstraintElectrostaticPotential|electrostatic potential boundary conditions]] it is important that they act on a face or body. Boundary conditions in 3D set to lines or vertices are not recognized by the Elmer solver.

==Results==

The available results depend on the [[#Solver_Settings|solver settings]]. If none of the {{PropertyData|Calculate *}} settings was set to ''true'', only the electric potential is calculated. Otherwise also the corresponding results will be available.

The possible results are:
* Joule heating in <math>\rm W/m^3</math>
* Nodal joule heating in <math>\rm W</math>
* Volume current in <math>\rm A/m^2</math>
* Potential in <math>\rm V</math>
