== Description == <!--T:2--> 

<!--T:3-->
The [[Image:Part_EditAttachment.svg|24px]] '''Part EditAttachment''' command attaches an object to one or more other objects. The attached object is linked to the referenced object(s), which means that if the [[Std Placement|placement]] or geometry of the referenced object(s) is changed, the placement of the attached object will update accordingly.

== Attacher engines == <!--T:109-->

<!--T:110-->
The attachment of an object is controlled by one of four attacher engines. The default engine that is used for an object depends on its type. An object's attacher engine can be changed via its {{PropertyData|Attacher Engine}} property ({{Version|1.0}}) or its [[Property_editor#Context_menu|hidden]] {{PropertyData|Attacher Type}} property.

<!--T:123-->
The available engines are listed in the table below. Attacher engines control the {{PropertyData|Placement}} of objects. All engines can be used for all objects that have this property. But the results of the last three make the most sense if the shape of the object matches the mentioned 'Logical Shape'.

<!--T:124-->
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attacher Engine !! Attacher Type !! Logical Shape
|-
| [[#Engine_3D|Engine 3D]] || Attacher::AttachEngine3D ||
|-
| [[#Engine_Plane|Engine Plane]] || Attacher::AttachEnginePlane || Planar face coincident with the XY plane of the Placement
|-
| [[#Engine_Line|Engine Line]] || Attacher::AttachEngineLine || Straight edge collinear with the Z axis of the Placement
|-
| [[#Engine_Point|Engine Point]] || Attacher::AttachEnginePoint || Vertex coincident with the origin of the Placement
|}

<!--T:112-->
The rest of this page focuses on the Engine 3D. The modes of the other engines are only listed. Note that the modes of Engine Plane are in fact identical to those of Engine 3D.

== Usage == <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
# Select the object to be attached.
# Do one of the following:
#* If the object already has a {{PropertyData|Map Mode}} property: click in that field in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]] and press the {{Button|...}} button that appears.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → [[Image:Part_EditAttachment.svg|16px]] Attachment...}} option from the menu.
# The {{MenuCommand|Attachment}} task panel opens.
# At the top of the task panel ''Not attached'' can be read. The first button labeled {{Button|Selecting...}} is highlighted to indicate a selection in the [[3D_view|3D View]] is expected.
# Select a vertex, edge or face/plane belonging to another object.
# In the input field to the right of the button, the referenced object and subelement are shown. For example, if a face of a [[Part_Box|Part Box]] is selected, the field may show {{Value|Box:Face6}}. The label of the button displays the subelement type now.
# The available modes are filtered based on the selected references and their order. For example, for modes [[#Align_O-Z-X|Align O-Z-X]] to [[#Align_O-Y-X|Align O-Y-X]] the first reference must be a vertex. If the first reference is a subelement of a different type, they are removed from the list.
# ''Attached with mode <description>'' is now displayed at the top of the task panel.
# Optionally select a different [[#Attachment mode|Attachment mode]] from the list. For information on the attachment modes, hover the mouse over them for a tooltip to appear.
# Depending on the selected  mode, add up to three more references by pressing the {{Button|Reference2}}, {{Button|Reference3}}, and {{Button|Reference4}} buttons and repeating step 5. It is also possible to specify all references before selecting an attachment mode.
# Optionally set an [[#Attachment Offset|Attachment Offset]].
# Press {{Button|OK}}.
# If applicable, optionally change the {{PropertyData|Map Path Parameter}} property in the [[Property_editor|Property editor]].

== Attachment offset == <!--T:78-->

<!--T:79-->
Attachment Offset becomes active when an attachment mode other than ''Deactivated'' has been selected. It is used to apply a linear or rotary offset within the attachment coordinate system (ACS), as defined by the attachment mode and the referenced object(s). 

<!--T:80-->
* '''In x-direction''': sets an offset distance along the X axis of the ACS.

<!--T:81-->
* '''In y-direction''': sets an offset distance along the Y axis of the ACS.

<!--T:82-->
* '''In z-direction''': sets an offset distance along the Z axis of the ACS.

<!--T:85-->
* '''Around x-axis''': rotates the attached object around the X axis of the ACS.

<!--T:84-->
* '''Around y-axis''': rotates the attached object around the Y axis of the ACS.

<!--T:83-->
* '''Around z-axis''': rotates the attached object around the Z axis of the ACS.

<!--T:86-->
* '''Flip sides''': if checked, the attachment is reversed. This is equivalent to rotating the object 180° around the Y axis of the ACS.

== Limitations == <!--T:87-->

<!--T:88-->
* If selecting two lines results in an error: "Points are collinear. Can't make a plane", try selecting three vertices instead [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=55088&p=473614#p473594].
