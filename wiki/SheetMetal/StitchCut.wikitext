= StitchCut Macro =
The **StitchCut** macro is designed for creating evenly spaced “stitch cuts” along lines in sheet metal flat patterns. These cuts make it easier to fold the material by hand.

== Features ==
- Start & End Offset - Automatically calculates **cut lengths** based on the number of cuts - Define number of cuts - Choose between **single line cuts** or cuts with **user-defined width** - Inserts cuts directly into the active sketch

== Usage ==
1. Enter **edit mode** on the sketch containing your fold line. 2. Select the line you want to apply stitch cuts to. 3. Run the macro and fill in the dialog:
   - Start & End Offset
   - Number of cuts
   - Cut Width (0 = single line cuts)
4. The macro deletes the original line and inserts the evenly spaced stitch cuts.
