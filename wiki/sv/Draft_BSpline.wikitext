==Description== 

The [[Image:Draft_BSpline.svg|24px]] '''Draft BSpline''' command creates a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline B-spline curve] from several points.

The Draft BSpline command specifies the {{Emphasis|exact points}} through which the curve will pass. The [[Draft BezCurve|Draft BezCurve]] and the [[Draft_CubicBezCurve|Draft CubicBezCurve]] commands, on the other hand, use {{Emphasis|control points}} to define the position and curvature of the spline.

==Usage==

# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_BSpline.svg|16px]] [[Draft_BSpline|B-Spline]]}} button.
#* [[Draft_Workbench|Draft]]: Select the {{MenuCommand|Drafting → [[Image:Draft_BSpline.svg|16px]] B-Spline}} option from the menu.
#* [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]]: Select the {{MenuCommand|2D Drafting → [[Image:Draft_BSpline.svg|16px]] B-Spline}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|B}} then {{KEY|S}}.
# The {{MenuCommand|B-Spline}} task panel opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Pick the first point in the [[3D_View|3D View]], or type coordinates and press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_AddPoint.svg|16px]] Enter Point}} button.
# Pick additional points in the [[3D_View|3D View]], or type coordinates and press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_AddPoint.svg|16px]] Enter Point}} button.
# Press {{KEY|Esc}} or the {{Button|Close}} button to finish the command.

==Options==

The single character keyboard shortcuts available in the task panel can be changed. See [[Draft_Preferences|Draft Preferences]]. The shortcuts mentioned here are the default shortcuts.

* To manually enter coordinates enter the X, Y and Z component, and press {{KEY|Enter}} after each. Or you can press the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_AddPoint.svg|16px]] Enter Point}} button when you have the desired values. It is advisable to move the pointer out of the [[3D_View|3D View]] before entering coordinates.
* Press {{KEY|R}} or click the {{MenuCommand|Relative}} checkbox to toggle relative mode. If relative mode is on, coordinates are relative to the last point, if available, else they are relative to the coordinate system origin.
* Press {{KEY|G}} or click the {{MenuCommand|Global}} checkbox to toggle global mode. If global mode is on, coordinates are relative to the global coordinate system, else they are relative to the [[Draft_SelectPlane|working plane]] coordinate system.
* Press {{KEY|F}} or click the {{MenuCommand|Filled}}{{VersionNoteMinus|1.0}} or {{MenuCommand|Make face}}{{VersionNote|1.1}} checkbox to toggle make face mode. If make face mode is on, the created spline will have {{PropertyData|Make Face}} set to {{TRUE}} and have a filled face, provided it is closed and does not self-intersect. A self-intersecting spline with a face will not display properly, for such a spline {{PropertyData|Make Face}} must be set to {{FALSE}}.
* Press {{KEY|N}} or click the {{MenuCommand|Continue}} checkbox to toggle continue mode. If continue mode is on, the command will restart after using {{Button|[[Image:Draft_FinishLine.svg|16px]] Finish}} or {{Button|[[Image:Draft_CloseLine.svg|16px]] Close}}, or after creating a closed spline by snapping to the first point of the spline, allowing you to continue creating splines.
* Press {{KEY|/}} or the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_UndoLine.svg|16px]] Undo}} button to undo the last point.
* Press {{KEY|A}} or the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_FinishLine.svg|16px]] Finish}} button to finish the command and leave the spline open.
* Press {{KEY|O}} or the {{Button|[[Image:Draft_CloseLine.svg|16px]] Close}} button to finish the command and close the spline. A closed spline can also be created by snapping to the first point of the spline.
* Press {{KEY|W}} or the {{Button|[[Image:Draft Wipe.svg|16px]] Wipe}} button to delete the curve segments already placed, but keep working from the last point.
* Press {{KEY|U}} or the {{Button|[[Image:Draft SelectPlane.svg|16px]] [[Draft_SelectPlane|Set Working Plane]]}} button to adjust the current working plane in the orientation defined by the last and the previous point.
* Press {{KEY|S}} to switch [[Draft_Snap|Draft snapping]] on or off.
* Press {{KEY|Esc}} or the {{Button|Close}} button to finish the command.

==Notes==

* A Draft BSpline can be edited with the [[Draft_Edit|Draft Edit]] command.
* A Draft BSpline can be converted to a [[Draft_Wire|Draft Wire]] with the [[Draft_WireToBSpline|Draft WireToBSpline]] command.

==Properties==

See also: [[Property_View|Property View]].

A Draft BSpline object is derived from a [[Part_Part2DObject|Part Part2DObject]]{{VersionNoteMinus|1.0}} or a [[Part_Feature|Part Feature]] object{{VersionNotePlus|1.1}} and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

=== Data ===

{{TitleProperty|Attachment}}

The object has the same attachment properties as a [[Part_Part2DObject#Data|Part Part2DObject]].

{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

* {{PropertyData|Area|Area}}: (read-only) specifies the area of the face of the spline. The value will be {{value|0.0}} if {{PropertyData|Make Face}} if {{FALSE}} or the face cannot be created.
* {{PropertyData|Closed|Bool}}: specifies if the spline is closed or not. If the spline is initially open this value is {{FALSE}}, setting it to {{TRUE}} will draw a curve segment to close the spline. If the spline is initially closed this value is {{TRUE}}, setting it to {{FALSE}} will remove the last curve segment and make the spline open.
* {{PropertyData|Make Face|Bool}}: specifies if the spline makes a face or not. If it is {{TRUE}} a face is created, otherwise only the perimeter is considered part of the object. This property only works if {{PropertyData|Closed}} is {{TRUE}} and if the spline does not self-intersect.
* {{PropertyData|Parameterization|Float}}: affects the shape of the spline.
* {{PropertyData|Points|VectorList}}: specifies the points of the spline in its local coordinate system.

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty|Draft}}

* {{PropertyView|Arrow Size|Length}}: specifies the size of the symbol displayed at the end of the spline.
* {{PropertyView|Arrow Type|Enumeration}}: specifies the type of symbol displayed at the end of the spline, which can be {{value|Dot}}, {{value|Circle}}, {{value|Arrow}}, {{value|Tick}} or {{value|Tick-2}}.
* {{PropertyView|End Arrow|Bool}}: specifies whether to show a symbol at the end of the spline, so it can be used as an annotation line.
* {{PropertyView|Pattern|Enumeration}}: specifies the [[Draft_Pattern|Draft Pattern]] with which to fill the face of the closed spline. This property only works if {{PropertyData|Make Face}} is {{TRUE}} and if {{PropertyView|Display Mode}} is {{value|Flat Lines}}.
* {{PropertyView|Pattern Size|Float}}: specifies the size of the [[Draft_Pattern|Draft Pattern]].

==Scripting==

See also: [https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/ Autogenerated API documentation] and [[FreeCAD Scripting Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

To create a Draft BSpline use the {{incode|make_bspline}} method ({{Version|0.19}}) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated {{incode|makeBSpline}} method.

{{Code|code=
bspline = make_bspline(pointslist, closed=False, placement=None, face=None, support=None)
bspline = make_bspline(Part.Wire, closed=False, placement=None, face=None, support=None)
}}

* Creates a {{incode|bspline}} object from the given list of points, {{incode|pointslist}}.
** Each point in the list is defined by its {{incode|FreeCAD.Vector}}, with units in millimeters.
** Alternatively, the input can be a {{incode|Part.Wire}}, from which points are extracted.
* If {{incode|closed}} is {{incode|True}}, or if the first and last points are identical, the spline is closed.
* If {{incode|placement}} is {{incode|None}} the spline is created at the origin.
* If {{incode|face}} is {{incode|True}}, and the spline is closed, the spline will make a face, that is, it will appear filled.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

p1 = App.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = App.Vector(1000, 1000, 0)
p3 = App.Vector(2000, 0, 0)

spline1 = Draft.make_bspline([p1, p2, p3], closed=False)
spline2 = Draft.make_bspline([p1, 2*p3, 1.3*p2], closed=False)
spline3 = Draft.make_bspline([1.3*p3, p1, -1.7*p2], closed=False)

doc.recompute()
}}
