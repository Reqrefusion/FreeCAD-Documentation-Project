==Description==

====Beskrivning====
</div>

{{Version|1.0}}: This tool is replaced by the [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified|Sketcher ConstrainCoincidentUnified]] tool if the '''Unify coincident and point-on-object constraints''' option is selected in the [[Sketcher_Preferences#General|preferences]].

==Usage==

See also: [[Sketcher_Workbench#Drawing_aids|Drawing aids]].

===[[Sketcher_Workbench#Continue_modes|Continue mode]]===

# Make sure there is no selection.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject|Point-On-Object Constraint]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Constraints → [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg|16px]] Point-On-Object Constraint}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|O}}.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Select a single point and a single edge (in any order).
# A constraint is added.
# Optionally keep creating constraints.
# To finish, right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

===Run-once mode===

# Do one of the following:
#* Select a single point and a single edge (in any order).
#* Select several points and a single edge (idem).
#* Select a single point and several edges (idem).
# Invoke the tool as described above, or with the following additional option:
#* Right-click in the {{MenuCommand|Elements}} section of the [[Sketcher_Dialog|Sketcher Dialog]] and select the {{MenuCommand|[[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainPointOnObject.svg|16px]] Point-On-Object Constraint}} option from the context menu.
# Depending on the selection one or more constraints are added.

==Scripting==

The constraint can be created from [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following command:

{{incode|Sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint('PointOnObject',LineMoving,PointOfLineMoving,LineFixed))}}

* {{incode|Sketch}} is a sketch object.
* {{incode|LineMoving}} is the number that designates the line, which contains the point that has to be moved on the {{incode|LineFixed}} (the line which is fixed). 
* {{incode|PointOfLineMoving}} is the number of the vertex of line {{incode|LineMoving}}, that has to be moved on the {{incode|LineFixed}}.
* {{incode|LinedFixed}} is the number of the line to be affixed on the point {{incode|PointOfLineMoving}}.

The [[Sketcher_scripting|Sketcher scripting]] page explains how to identify the numbers that designate lines and points.
