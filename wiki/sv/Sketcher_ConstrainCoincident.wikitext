==Description== 

The [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Sketcher ConstrainCoincident]] tool creates a coincident constraint between points, or ({{Version|0.21}}) a concentric constraint between circles, arcs and/or ellipses (by making their centers coincident).

{{Version|1.0}}: This tool is replaced by the [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified|Sketcher ConstrainCoincidentUnified]] tool if the '''Unify Coincident and PointOnObject''' option is selected in the [[Sketcher_Preferences#General|preferences]].

==Usage==

See also: [[Sketcher_Workbench#Drawing_aids|Drawing aids]].

===[[Sketcher_Workbench#Continue_modes|Continue mode]]===

# Make sure there is no selection.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool: 
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|Constrain coincident]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → Sketcher constraints → [[Image:Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident.svg|16px]] Constrain coincident}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|C}}.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Do one of the following:
#* Select two points.
#* Select two edges of circles, arcs, ellipses or arcs of ellipses.
# A constraint is added.
# Optionally keep creating constraints.
# To finish, right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

===Run-once mode===

# Do one of the following:
#* Select two or more points.
#* Select two or more edges of circles, arcs, ellipses or arcs of ellipses.
# Invoke the tool as explained above.
# Depending on the selection one or more constraints are added.

==Notes==

* {{Version|1.0}}: Points with Coincident constraints are marked with the '''Constraint symbols''' [[Sketcher_Preferences#Display|color]].

==Scripting==

The constraint can be created from [[Macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following command:

{{Code|code=Sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint('Coincident',LineFixed,PointOfLineFixed,LineMoving,PointOfLineMoving)) }}

where :
* {{incode|Sketch}} is a sketch object
* {{incode|LineFixed}} is the number of the line, that will not move  by applying the constraint
* {{incode|PointOfLineFixed}} indicates which vertex of {{incode|LineFixed}} has to fulfill the constraint
* {{incode|LineMoving}} is the number of the line, that will move by applying the constraint
* {{incode|PointOfLineMoving}} indicates which vertex of {{incode|LineMoving}} has to fulfill the constraint

As the names {{incode|LineFixed}} and {{incode|LineMoving}} indicate, if both constrained vertices are free to move in any direction, the first one (first to be selected in the Gui) will remain fixed and the other one will move. In the presence of existing constraints, however, both edges may move.

The [[Sketcher_scripting|Sketcher scripting]] page explains the values which can be used for {{incode|LineFixed}}, {{incode|PointOfLineFixed}}, {{incode|LineMoving}} and {{incode|PointOfLineMoving}}, and contains further examples on how to create constraints from Python scripts.
