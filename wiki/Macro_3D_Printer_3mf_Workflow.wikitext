3D_printer_3mf_workflow

FreeCAD macro exporting smooth 3MF files and preserving all slicer print settings, with automatic workflow to your preferred slicer.
Purpose

This macro automates and enhances the 3D printing workflow from FreeCAD to your slicer by:

• Generating smooth 3D prints without visible facets

• Preserving print settings (temperature, supports, speed…) directly within the FreeCAD project

• Launching external programs to streamline the full pipeline: FreeCAD → Slicer → Print 


This macro is the successor to macro 3d_printer_workflow.

While the previous version enabled smooth exports and program launching, it relied on .stl files, which cannot store print settings.

This macro uses .3mf files, allowing full geometry + print configuration to be preserved and reused.

To retain the core functionality of the previous macro, this version also provides an STL export option with adjustable tessellation parameters, allowing smooth mesh generation just like before.
