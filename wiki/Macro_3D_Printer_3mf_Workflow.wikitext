FreeCAD macro exporting smooth 3MF files and preserving all slicer print settings, with automatic workflow to your preferred slicer.

=== Purpose ===

This macro automates and enhances the 3D printing workflow from FreeCAD to your slicer by:
* Generating smooth 3D prints without visible facets.
* Preserving print settings (temperature, supports, speed…) directly within the FreeCAD project.
* Launching external programs to streamline the full pipeline: FreeCAD → Slicer → Print.

This macro is the successor to macro 3d_printer_workflow.

While the previous version enabled smooth exports and program launching, it relied on .stl files, which cannot store print settings.

This macro uses .3mf files, allowing full geometry + print configuration to be preserved and reused.

To retain the core functionality of the previous macro, this version also provides an STL export option with adjustable tessellation parameters, allowing smooth mesh generation just like before.

=== Limitation ===

The current version can export only a single object, but you can work around this by using links — for example, a Simple Group — to combine multiple objects into one.

=== Principle of smoothing ===

The macro exports the selected objects to a 3MF file using the specified tessellation parameters (LinearDeflection and AngularDeflection). It generates temporary mesh objects for the export process and automatically removes them afterward.

=== Launching other programs or commands === 

The macro allows you to define custom commands that will be executed automatically after the 3MF file is generated. This feature is optional and can be used to automate additional steps in your workflow, such as:
* copying the generated 3MF file to another location
* turning on your 3D printer through a smart plug
* turn a light on
* pre‑heating the build plate
* sending an HTTP request to your home automation system
* launching a script or external tool

== Setup ==

A dedicated helper macro is provided to make configuration easy. Your commands are stored in an .ini file used by the workflow.

Run the macro 3D_Printer_3mf_Workflow_ConfigIni.FCMacro
* Fill in the fields in the configuration window
* Hover your mouse over a column title to display help tooltips
* Each command you define will be executed in order after the 3MF file is produced.
