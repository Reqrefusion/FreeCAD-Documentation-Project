==Description==

The Arch Building is a special type of FreeCAD group object particularly suited for representing a whole building unit. They are mostly used to organize your model, by containing [[Arch Floor|floor]] objects.

==Usage==

# Optionally, select one or more objects to be included in your new building.
# Press the {{Button|[[Image:Arch Building.svg|16px]] [[Arch_Building|Building]]}} button, or press the {{KEY|B}} then {{KEY|U}} keys.

==Options==

* Starting from FreeCAD version 0.18, the Building object is actually a [[Arch BuildingPart|BuildingPart]] with its {{PropertyData|IFC Type}} property set to "Building". You can convert any BuildingPart to a Building simply by changing its IFC Type.
* After creating a building, you can add more objects to it by drag and dropping them in the Tree View or by using the {{Button|[[Image:Arch Add.svg|16px]] [[Arch Add|Arch Add]]}} tool.
* You can remove objects from a building by drag and dropping them out of it the Tree View or by using the {{Button|[[Image:Arch Remove.svg|16px]] [[Arch Remove|Arch Remove]]}} tool.

==Properties==

* {{PropertyData|Building Type}}: The type of this building, to choose from a list

==Scripting==

{{Emphasis|See also:}} [[Arch API|Arch API]] and [[FreeCAD Scripting Basics|FreeCAD Scripting Basics]].

The Building tool can be used in [[macros|macros]] and from the [[Python|Python]] console by using the following function:
{{Code|code=
Building = makeBuilding(objectslist=None, baseobj=None, name="Building")
}}

* Creates a {{incode|Building}} object from {{incode|objectslist}}, which is a list of objects, or {{incode|baseobj}}, which is a {{incode|Shape}}.

Example:

{{Code|code=
import FreeCAD, Draft, Arch

p1 = FreeCAD.Vector(0, 0, 0)
p2 = FreeCAD.Vector(2000, 0, 0)
baseline = Draft.makeLine(p1, p2)
baseline2 = Draft.makeLine(p1, -1*p2)

Wall1 = Arch.makeWall(baseline, length=None, width=150, height=2000)
Wall2 = Arch.makeWall(baseline2, length=None, width=150, height=1800)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()

Building = Arch.makeBuilding([Wall1, Wall2])

Site = Arch.makeSite(Building)
FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.recompute()
}}
