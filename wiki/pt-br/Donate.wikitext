Below are the different donation options currently supported by the project. Remember, it will never be required to pay money to use, study, distribute or develop FreeCAD. Donations however help FreeCAD and its developers to dedicate time and resources to make the project grow faster and further.

There have been a couple of successful experiments in the past, such as the [[Path_Workbench|Path Workbench]] or [https://opendeveloperfunding.wordpress.com/ Ian Rees's funding experiment]. The following developers can be sponsored individually.

== Sponsoring ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
We call sponsoring the act of donating money recurrently to the FreeCAD project. You can do that as an individual or as a company or institution, through different channels or platforms, depending on your preferences. You can sponsor FreeCAD via the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsoring page].
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Sponsoring FreeCAD allows its developers to count on a steady flow of income, so it allows the FPA to plan things ahead, and the FreeCAD developers to invest themselves more seriously into FreeCAD.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To encourage persons and companies to sponsor the FreeCAD project, we have created different sponsoring tiers. By donating regularly to the project, you will have the possibility to have your name, company name and/or logo to be featured on the FreeCAD website, depending on the tier you fit into:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* ‚ô• Normal sponsor: from 1 USD / 1 EUR per month. You will not have your name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], but you will have helped the project a lot anyway. Together, normal sponsors maintain the project on its feet as much as the bigger sponsors.
* ü•â Bronze sponsor: from 25 USD / 25 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page].
* ü•à Silver sponsor: from 100 USD / 100 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], with a link to your website, and a one-line description text.
* ü•á Gold sponsor: from 200 USD / 200 EUR per month. Allows you to have your name or company name and logo displayed on the [https://www.freecad.org/sponsor.php sponsors page], with a link to your website and a custom description text. Companies that have helped FreeCAD early on will also appear under Gold sponsors.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Instead of donating each month, you might find it more comfortable to make a one-time donation that, when divided by twelve, would give you right to enter a sponsoring tier. Don't hesitate to do so!
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== The FPA ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The '''FreeCAD project association''' (FPA) is a non-profit association created in 2022 by FreeCAD's administrators and core developers and seated in Belgium. It is responsible for transparently collecting, handling and distributing the money collected via donations. More details and reports are available on the [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FPA FPA page]. Excepting the [https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD LiberaPay team account], which is directly manager by its members, all other donation channels above are handled and managed by the FPA.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
== Tax deductions ==
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The FPA, although it is a non-profit organization, is not a charity organization. People and companies donating to the FPA are therefore [https://finances.belgium.be/fr/particuliers/avantages_fiscaux/dons not entitled to a tax deduction] by Belgian law. Each country, however, has its own rules and laws to decide upon what gives their citizen right to tax reduction or not. You are always advised to consult the laws of your own country.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The FPA can anyway always issue a donation receipt. [mailto:fpa@freecad.org Mail us] with your donation details and we will gladly send you a receipt.
</div>
