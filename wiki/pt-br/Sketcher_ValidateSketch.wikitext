==Descrição==

The [[Image:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Sketcher ValidateSketch]] tool can analyze and repair a sketch that is no longer editable or has invalid constraints, or add missing [[Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident|coincident constraints]] to a sketch created from imported geometry such as DXF files. It can also be useful to locate a missing coincidence in a native sketch that generates an error when trying to apply a PartDesign feature.

==Usage==

# This tool cannot be used while a sketch is in edit mode. To finish edit mode see [[Sketcher_LeaveSketch|Sketcher LeaveSketch]].
# Select a sketch.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_ValidateSketch|Validate Sketch]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → [[Image:Sketcher_ValidateSketch.svg|16px]] Validate Sketch}} option from the menu.
# The '''Sketch Validation''' task panel opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.
# Press the {{Button|Close}} button to finish.

==Options==

===Missing Coincidences===

Finds out missing coincidences for overlapping vertices, and adds them. Press the {{Button|Find}} button; a pop up dialog will appear to report how many missing coincidences were found; they will be shown in the 3D View as yellow crosses. Press {{Button|OK}} to close the dialog, then press the {{Button|Fix}} button to add the missing coincidences.

If necessary, define a different tolerance value in the drop-down field.

Press {{Button|Highlight Troublesome Vertices}} to highlight vertexes that are outside this tolerance.

This tolerance is also used by the {{Button|Find}}/{{Button|Fix}} process.

Leave the "Ignore construction geometry" checkbox checked to disregard construction geometry in the analysis.

===Invalid Constraints===

Checks for malformed constraints.

For example, if there is a Circle-Line-Tangent constraint, but it references two lines, it is considered invalid.

(This sometimes happens due to the [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological naming problem]], i.e. the external geometry changes type).

It also does other checks, such as for empty links.

===Degenerated Geometry===

Degenerated geometry can result from solver actions in a sketch.

For instance, if a line is forced to shorten to become almost a point.

Other examples: a zero length line or zero radius circle/arc.

===Reversed External Geometry===

Reversed external geometry can happen because the handling of reversed geometry was changed around revision 0.15.

This process might be helpful if sketches with external-geometry fail to solve because of these changes.

===Constraint Orientation Locking===

Tangent and perpendicular constraints are implemented (via-point).

Internally they work by constraining the angle between tangent vectors. With tangent constraint for example, the angle can be 0 or 180 degrees (co-directed or opposed vectors). The actual angle is remembered in the constraint data ("constraint orientation is locked"), it guards against flipping. But the angle can be erased ("constraint orientation unlock") or updated; these tools do exactly that. 

The locking mechanism typically works well and this tool should not be needed. '''It should only used after making a backup of the open document.'''
