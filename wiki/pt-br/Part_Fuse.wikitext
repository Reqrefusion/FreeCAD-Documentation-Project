== Description ==

The [[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|24px]] '''Part Fuse''' command fuses (unites) selected Part objects into one. This operation is fully parametric and the components can be modified and the result recomputed.

This command is an automated form of the [[Image:Part_Boolean.svg|16px|link=Part_Boolean]] [[Part_Boolean|Boolean Operation]].

== Usage ==

# Select two or more shapes
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|16px]] [[Part_Fuse|Fuse]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Part → Boolean → [[Image:Part_Fuse.svg|16px]] Fuse}} option from the menu.

== Supported inputs ==

Input objects must be [[OpenCASCADE|OpenCASCADE]] shapes. Examples: stuff made with Part, PartDesign, Sketcher workbenches. Not meshes (unless those were converted to shapes) - for meshes, there are specific Boolean commands in MeshDesign workbench.

* Solid + Solid: the result is a solid that occupies all the volume covered by the inputs

* Shell + Shell, Shell + Face, Face + Face: the result is a shell. Where faces intersect, they are split. Shells can be non-manifold. After fusion, faces can be united by [[Part_RefineShape|Refining]] the result.

* Wire + Wire, Edge + Wire, Edge + Edge: the result is a wire. Edges are split where they intersect. 

Compounds are supported; however, it is assumed that shapes packed into a compound do not touch or intersect. If they actually do, Fusion will likely fail, or produce an incorrect result.

== Options ==

Items can be added and removed from a fusion, by dragging them in or out of the fusion feature in the Tree View with the mouse. To drag items out of a fusion you have to drop them onto the document node (the filename) of your model. A manual recompute (press {{KEY|F5}} key or click on the [[Image:Std_Refresh.svg|24px]] [[Std_Refresh|Recompute]] icon) is required to see the results.
