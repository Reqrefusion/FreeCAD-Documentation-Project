==Description==

The [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity|Sketcher BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity]] tool decreases the multiplicity of a [[B-Splines|B-spline]] knot.

==Usage==

# Select a B-spline knot.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity|Decrease Knot Multiplicity]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → B-Spline Tools → [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|16px]] Decrease Knot Multiplicity}} option from the menu.

==Example==

See [[Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity#Example|Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity]]

==Notes==

If you decrease the multiplicity of a knot to zero, the knot vanishes. Mathematically it then appears zero times in the knot vector, meaning there is no longer a basis function. Understanding this requires some math, but it will also be clear if you look at the multiplicity. For example a knot with multiplicity 0 on a B-spline with degree 3 
means that at the position of the knot two Bézier pieces are connected with ''C<sup>3</sup>'' continuity. So the third derivative should be equal on both sides of the knot. However for a cubic Bézier curve this means that both sides must be part of the same curve. There is then effectively no longer a knot connecting two Bézier curves.
