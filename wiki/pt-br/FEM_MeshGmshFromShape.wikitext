==Descrição==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
For a finite elements analysis the geometry needs to be discretized into a [[FEM_Mesh|FEM Mesh]]. This command uses the software [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmsh Gmsh] (which needs to be installed on the system) to generate the mesh.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Depending on your operating system and your installation package, Gmsh might be bundled with FreeCAD or not. For further information see [[FEM_Install#FEM_mesh_generator|FEM Install]].
</div>

<span id="Usage"></span>
==Utilização== 

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
# Select the shape you want to analyze. For volume FEM this needs to be a solid or compsolid. A compsolid is necessary if your part is made from multiple materials (a compsolid can be created with the [[Part_BooleanFragments|BooleanFragments]] command).
# There are several ways to invoke the command:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:FEM_MeshGmshFromShape.svg|16px]] [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Mesh From Shape by Gmsh]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Mesh → [[Image:FEM_MeshGmshFromShape.svg|16px]] Mesh From Shape by Gmsh}} option from the menu.
# Optionally, edit the minimum and maximum element size (the default setting often creates meshes that are too coarse). You can also change the element dimension (but the default ''From shape'' setting is normally sufficient) and order.
# Click the {{Button|Apply}} button and wait for the generation of the mesh to complete. {{Version|1.0}}: Optionally, press the {{Button|Cancel}} button to abort meshing.
# Click the {{Button|OK}} button to close the task. You now should see a new FEMMeshGmsh object in your active analysis container. You can also click the {{Button|Cancel}} button to cancel the changes or creation of the mesh object.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
After the mesh has been created, you can change its properties using the [[Property_View|Property View]]. After you change a property, you must reopen the Gmsh dialog again and click the {{Button|Apply}} button (you can leave the dialog open while changing properties).
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The {{Button|Gmsh version}} button allows you to check the details about the currently linked Gmsh binary.

== Propriedades ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* {{PropertyData|Algorithm2D}}: The algorithm to create 2D meshes. The different algorithms are [https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Choosing-the-right-unstructured-algorithm explained here]. For Delaunay, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation Delaunay triangulation].
* {{PropertyData|Algorithm3D}}: The algorithm to create 3D meshes. The different algorithms are [https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Choosing-the-right-unstructured-algorithm explained here].
* {{PropertyData|Characteristic Length Max}}: The maximal size of the mesh elements. If set to ''0.0'', the size will be set automatically. This property can also be changed in the Gmsh dialog in the field '''Max element size'''.
* {{PropertyData|Characteristic Length Min}}: The minimal size of the mesh elements. If set to ''0.0'', the size will be set automatically. This property can also be changed in the Gmsh dialog in the field '''Min element size'''.
* {{PropertyData|Coherence Mesh}}:
** true (default); duplicate mesh nodes will be removed
** false
* {{PropertyData|Element Dimension}}: The dimension of the mesh elements. This property can also be changed in the Gmsh dialog in the field '''Mesh element dimension'''.
** From Shape (default); the dimension will be determined from the dimension of the object that is meshed
** 1D
** 2D
** 3D
* {{PropertyData|Element Order}}: The [https://www.comsol.de/support/knowledgebase/1270 mesh element order]. This property can also be changed in the Gmsh dialog in the field '''Mesh order'''. {{Version|0.20}}
** 1st
** 2nd (default)</br>'''Note:''' If you use the solver [[FEM_SolverElmer|Elmer]] you may get this error: ''ERROR:: GetEdgeBasis: Can't handle but linear elements, sorry.'' This means the solver equation cannot handle 2nd order meshes. Use either 1st order meshes then, or check the FreeCAD Wiki page for the solver equation for possible options to handle 2nd order meshes.
* {{PropertyData|Geometry Tolerance}}: The geometrical tolerance for the mesh to match the object edges. The default ''0.0'' means that Gmsh's default of 1e-8 is used.
* {{PropertyData|Groups Of Nodes}}: All nodes and not only the elements will be saved for each physical mesh group. Physical groups are collections of mesh entities (points, curves, surfaces and volumes). They  and are identified by their dimension and by a tag. For example a mesh of the same object region is internally tagged the same. So all surfaces of this region will form one physical group.
* {{PropertyData|High Order Optimize}}: If and how meshes with {{PropertyData|Element Order}} = ''2nd'' are optimized. The optimization is done by a deformation of the element borders.</br>{{Version|0.20}} Gmsh supports different optimization algorithms. '''Elastic''' is an algorithm in which the mesh elements are treated as a collection of deformable viscoelastic solids. 1st order meshes cannot be optimized because their element borders are linear an cannot be deformed.
* {{PropertyData|Mesh Size From Curvature}} {{Version|0.20}}: The number of mesh elements per <math>2\pi</math> times the radius of the curvature. To get a finer mesh at small corners or holes, this value can be increased for better results
[[Image:FEM_Gmsh-MeshSizeFromCurvature.png|450px]]
{{Caption|Effect of  ''Mesh Size From Curvature'''; left: set to 12, right: deactivated}}
* {{PropertyData|Optimize Netgen}}: Whether the mesh will be optimized using  the 3D mesh generator [https://github.com/NGSolve/netgen Netgen] to improve the quality of tetrahedral elements. '''Note:''' since Netgen can only create tetrahedral elements, this option is ignored for meshes whose {{PropertyData|Element Dimension}} is not ''3D''.
* {{PropertyData|Optimize Std}} Optimizes the mesh to improve the quality of tetrahedral elements.
* {{PropertyData|Recombination Algorithm}} {{Version|0.20}}: The algorithm used for {{PropertyData|Recombine 3D All}} and also for {{PropertyData|Recombine All}}. For more info, see section [[#Element_Recombination|Element Recombination]] and for technical details see the [https://www.gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#t11 Gmsh documentation].
* {{PropertyData|Recombine 3D All}} {{Version|0.20}}: Applies a recombination 3D-algorithm to all volumes. Tetrahedra will be recombined into prisms, hexahedra or pyramids if possible. 
* {{PropertyData|Recombine All}}: Applies a recombination algorithm to all surfaces. Triangles will be recombined into quadrangles when possible. 
* {{PropertyData|Second Order Linear}}: Option if second order nodes (if {{PropertyData|Element Order}} set to ''2nd'') and/or mesh refinement points are created by linear interpolation.
** true;  linear interpolation is used
** false (default); curvilinear interpolation is used
* {{PropertyData|Subdivision Algorithm}} {{Version|1.0}}: allows the creation of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements by subdivision
** None; doesn't use any subdivision algorithm
** All Quadrangles; creates quadrilateral elements by subdivision
** All Hexahedra; creates hexahedral elements by subdivision
** Barycentric; creates triangular elements by barycentric subdivision

=== Nonpositive Jacobians ===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
When you get a meshing error about nonpositive Jacobians, you can try out the following strategies:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
* Set {{PropertyData|Second Order Linear}} to ''true'' but keep {{PropertyData|Element Order}} at ''2nd''.
* Set {{PropertyData|Element Order}} to ''1st''.
* Use a smaller element size by reducing the {{PropertyData|Characteristic Length Max}}.
* If solver ccxtools is used and the run button is used (not the task panel) the nodes of nonpositive jacobian elements will be green.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
===Mesh Growth===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
At edges and small geometric entities, the mesh has to be smaller than in areas without edges. So the mesh element size grows away from the edges. The growing strategy of Gmsh is to grow between edges of different sizes. So the growing fails when an area has the same sized edges like for example this tube:
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[Image:FEM_Gmsh-MeshGrowth-failing.png|400px]]
{{Caption|Failing mesh growing because the cylindrical area is surrounded by the same edges}}
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To enable a sensible mesh growing, you must in this case add an edge to the area. In the example, this would be a circle in the middle of the cylinder. The circle is added as part of a [[Part_BooleanFragments|BooleanFragments]] compound (to form a CompSolid), see [https://forum.freecad.org/download/file.php?id=146255 the project file] of the example.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
===Element Recombination===
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Elements can be recombined in two ways, on the surface of objects so that triangles will be recombined into quadrangles if possible and in the volume of objects so that tetrahedra will be recombined into prisms, hexahedra or pyramids if possible. Thinking about the geometry, it becomes clear that the recombination result depends strongly on the geometry of the body and that recombining a 3D body only at the surface will mostly lead to strange results.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
To illustrate this, look at the image below. A cuboid body is meshed using the standard settings (tetrahedra, 2nd order mesh). This is the subimage at the upper left. The image at the upper right shows the result, when additionally the elements are recombined only at the surface of the body. The result is bad because the changed surface elements don't fit to the unchanged volume elements. So {{PropertyData|Recombine All}} alone usually only makes sense for 2D meshes. </br>When we use now also {{PropertyData|Recombine 3D All}}, the result is better, see the lower left subimage. However, the result doesn't show a great difference compared to the mesh without recombinations. Since our body is a cuboid, it is therefore sensible to use a recombination algorithm that tries to create cuboids as well. And this result is shown in the subimage at the lower right.
</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The ''Simple'' recombination algorithm will leave some triangles in the mesh in case the recombining leads to badly shaped quads. In such cases use a ''full-quad'' recombination algorithm, which will automatically perform a coarser mesh followed by the recombination, smoothing and subdividing. See [https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20351#p520392 forum topic]
