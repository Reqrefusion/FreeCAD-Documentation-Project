==Description==

{{Button|[[File:Std_LinkMakeGroup.svg|16px]] [[Std_LinkMakeGroup|Std LinkMakeGroup]]}} creates a specialized container called a LinkGroup. Unlike a [[Std_Group|Std Group]], a LinkGroup has its own coordinate system (Placement) and can manage the lifecycle of its contents through different modes. It is primarily used for organizing assemblies and managing complex object references.

=== Historical note ===
This command was originally envisaged for the Assembly 3 third-party workbench, and it was added to FreeCAD's core in v0.19 as part of the [[App_Link|App Link]] introduction. As such, it predates the introduction of FreeCAD 1.0's built-in [[Assembly_Workbench|Assembly Workbench]]. Thus some of [[Std_LinkMakeGroup|Std LinkMakeGroup]]'s features may no longer apply to building assemblies when using the Assembly workbench.

==Usage==

===With selection===

# Select one or more objects in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] or [[3D_view|3D view]].
# Right-click on the selection to display the context menu.
# Navigate to {{MenuCommand|Link Actions → Link Group}} in the context menu.
# Select one of the options from the menu:
#* {{MenuCommand|Simple Group}}: Creates an empty [[App_LinkGroup|LinkGroup]] and moves the selected objects into it as-is. The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property is set to {{Value|None}}.
#* {{MenuCommand|Group With Links}}: Creates a new [[App_Link|Link]] for every selected object and places these links inside the LinkGroup.
#** The original objects remain in their original location in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
#** The {{PropertyData|Placement}} of the original objects is copied to the new links so they appear in the same spot.
#** The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property of the group is set to {{Value|Auto Delete}}.
#* {{MenuCommand|Group With Transform Links}}: Creates a new [[App_Link|Link]] for every selected object and places them inside the LinkGroup.
#** The {{PropertyData|LinkTransform}} property of each created link is set to {{Value|True}}.
#** The original position of the source objects is not copied; all new links are reset to the center {{Value|(0,0,0)}}.
#** The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property of the group is set to {{Value|Auto Delete}}.

===Without selection===

# Right-click on an empty area, either on the [[Tree_view|Tree view]] panel or on the [[3D_view|3D view]], to display the context menu.
# Navigate to {{MenuCommand|Link Actions → Link Group}} in the context menu.
# Select an option from the menu:
#* {{MenuCommand|Simple Group}}: Creates an empty [[App_LinkGroup|LinkGroup]]. The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property is set to {{Value|None}}.
#* {{MenuCommand|Group With Links}}: Creates an empty [[App_LinkGroup|LinkGroup]]. The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property is set to {{Value|Auto Delete}}.
#* {{MenuCommand|Group With Transform Links}}: Creates an empty [[App_LinkGroup|LinkGroup]]. The {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} property is set to {{Value|Auto Delete}}.

===Notes===

* To add objects to a {{Incode|LinkGroup}} after its creation, drag and drop objects into the group in the [[Tree_view|Tree view]].
* In groups where {{PropertyData|LinkMode}} is set to {{Value|Auto Delete}}, removing an object from the group or dragging it out of the folder will permanently delete that object from the document.
* When {{PropertyData|LinkTransform}} is {{Value|True}}, the link's {{PropertyData|Placement}} becomes a read-only indicator (shown in green). To move the link, you must modify the (usually hidden) {{PropertyData|Link Placement}} property.


==Properties==

=== Data === 

{{TitleProperty| Link}}

* {{PropertyData|Placement|Placement}}: Standard placement of the LinkGroup. Objects inside the group are positioned relative to this coordinate system. In other words, moving a LinkGroup moves all its contents in the 3D view.
* {{PropertyData|Link Mode|Enumeration}}: Controls the automated behavior of the group when objects are added or removed:
** {{value|None}}: The group acts as a simple container. Removing an object from the group does not affect the object's existence in the document.
** {{value|Auto Delete}}: The group assumes ownership of its contents. If an object is removed from the {{PropertyData|Element List}} or dragged out of the group in the Tree View, the object is permanently deleted from the document.
** {{value|Auto Link}}: If a document object is added to the group, the group automatically wraps it in an [[App_Link|App Link]].
** {{value|Auto UnLink}}: A selective cleanup mode. It distinguishes between objects that the group created automatically (such as "helper links" generated via the {{value|Auto Link}} mode) and objects that the user manually moved into the group. It will only delete the objects it created itself; any "guest" objects the user added are preserved when they are removed from the group.
* {{PropertyData|Element List|LinkList|Hidden}}: An internal list of references to the document objects contained within the group.
* {{PropertyData|Visibility List|BoolList|Hidden}}: A boolean list that stores the visibility state of each item in the {{PropertyData|Element List}}. This allows the group to manage the visibility of its contents independently of the objects' own settings. To edit or view this property in the Property 

=== View ===

{{TitleProperty| Link}}

* {{PropertyView|Draw Style|Enumeration}}
* {{PropertyView|Line Width|FloatConstraint}}
* {{PropertyView|Override Material|Bool}}: it defaults to {{FALSE}}; if set to {{TRUE}} it will override the {{PropertyData|Linked Object}}'s material, and it will display the colors defined in {{PropertyView|Shape Material}}.
* {{PropertyView|Point Size|FloatConstraint}}
* {{PropertyView|Selectable|Bool}}
* {{PropertyView|Shape Material|Material}}
