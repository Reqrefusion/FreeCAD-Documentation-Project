==Usage== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
Copy the macro in your macros' folder and run (see [[How_to_install_macros|How to install macros]] for further details).

<!--T:6-->
*Just select the vertices and the result will be shown in the Report View.
*Edges may also be selected and count as two vertices.
*A circular edge can also be selected.
*If two edges are selected the end vertex of the second edge is not used in the calculation.

<!--T:7-->
You can either select elements and then launch the macro or launch the macro without selection and select elements after launch.

If not enough elements are selected before launching the macro, you must select the missing elements.
