==Description== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:9-->
The [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity|Sketcher BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity]] tool increases the multiplicity of a [[B-Splines|B-spline]] knot.

==Usage== <!--T:5-->

<!--T:14-->
# Select a B-spline knot.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[File:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity|Increase Knot Multiplicity]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → B-Spline Tools → [[Image:Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity.svg|16px]] Increase Knot Multiplicity}} option from the menu.

==Example== <!--T:22-->

<!--T:15-->
B-splines are basically a combination of [[B-Splines#B.C3.A9zier_curves|Bézier curves]] (nicely explained in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1MrrqBAl8 this] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXJylM2S72s this] video). The points where two Bézier pieces are connected are called knots. A knot with multiplicity ''m'' on a B-spline with degree ''d'' means the curve to the left and right of the knot has at least an equal ''n'' order derivative (called ''C<sup>n</sup>'' continuity) where ''n = d - m''.

<!--T:23-->
In this cubic B-spline (degree 3) there are 3 segments, meaning 3 curves are connected at 2 knots. The knots have multiplicity 1.

<!--T:24-->
The multiplicity is indicated by the numbers in round brackets. See [[File:Sketcher_BSplineKnotMultiplicity.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_BSplineKnotMultiplicity|Toggle B-Spline Knot Multiplicity]].

<!--T:17-->
A multiplicity of 3 will change this B-spline so that even the first order derivatives are not equal (''C<sup>0</sup>'' continuity). Here is the same B-spline where the multiplicity of the knot on the left was increased to 3:

<!--T:19-->
A consequence of a higher multiplicity is that for the price of loosing continuity you gain local control. Meaning changing one control point will only affect the B-spline locally.

<!--T:25-->
This can be seen in this example, where the B-spline with knot multiplicity 1 from the first image above was taken, and the second control point from the right was moved up. As a result the complete shape of the B-spline has changed:

<!--T:26-->
After increasing the multiplicity of the knots to 2, moving the second control point from the right results in significant changes on the right side of the shape only:

* Knot multiplicity can also be increased with [[Sketcher_BSplineInsertKnot|Sketcher BSplineInsertKnot]].
