== Hierarchy is confusing ==

The ToC lists some chapters with the same level, such as "Examples", "Structure" and whatever comes below until "Create, rename and delete pages", despite all having different formats and collapsability:
"Examples" and "Create, rename and delete pages" can't be collapsed and they show as the same level everything in between, which leads to think they bear different importance or they are included somehow? [[User:Yosyp|Yosyp]] ([[User talk:Yosyp|talk]]) 10:16, 4 December 2025 (UTC)
