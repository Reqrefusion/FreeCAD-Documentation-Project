==Description== <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
The [[Image:Sketcher_CarbonCopy.svg|24px]] [[Sketcher_CarbonCopy|Sketcher CarbonCopy]] tool copies all geometry and constraints from another sketch into the active sketch.

<!--T:13-->
Dimensional constraints which exist before the copy operation remain linked to the original sketch's dimensional constraints through [[Expressions|expressions]].

==Usage== <!--T:4-->

<!--T:5-->
# Make sure you are in the edit mode of an existing [[Sketcher_NewSketch|sketch]]. This sketch is the target of the operation.
# There are several ways to invoke the tool:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Sketcher_CarbonCopy.svg|16px]] [[Sketcher_CarbonCopy|Carbon Copy]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Sketcher → Sketcher Tools → [[Image:Sketcher_CarbonCopy.svg|16px]] Carbon Copy}} option from the menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|G}} then {{KEY|W}}.
# The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
# Pick an edge from another sketch. This sketch is the source of the operation. See [[#Notes|Notes]].
# Geometry elements as well as constraints are copied into the active sketch.
# This tool always runs in continue mode: optionally copy additional sketches.
# To finish, right-click or press {{KEY|Esc}}, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

==Notes== <!--T:16-->

<!--T:14-->
* In the [[PartDesign_Workbench|PartDesign Workbench]] it is possible to select the sketch to carbon copy from outside the [[PartDesign_Body|Body]] of the currently active sketch, but only if the {{KEY|Ctrl}} key is held down during selection.
* The sketch to carbon copy should be plane-parallel to the currently active sketch. If that is not the case the {{KEY|Ctrl}} and {{KEY|Alt}} keys must be held down during selection. This works for sketches located outside the active Body as well.
* If [[Sketcher_ToggleConstruction|construction mode]] is active, copied geometry is created as construction geometry.
* The complete sketch is copied, it is not possible to select only a portion. But after copying you can delete unwanted elements.
