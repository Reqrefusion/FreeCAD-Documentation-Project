'''FreeCAD 1.0''' was released on '''18 November 2024''', get it from the [[Download|Download]] page. This page lists all new features and changes.

<!--T:5-->
Older FreeCAD release notes can be found in the [[Feature_list#Release_notes|Feature list]].

== In memoriam: Bradley McLean (bgbsww) == <!--T:141-->

<!--T:140-->
As much as we're delighted to present you this new version, we are also sad to announce that our friend and prolific FreeCAD developer [https://github.com/bgbsww bgbsww] has passed away a few weeks before this release came out. He was one of the main architects of the topological naming fixing effort, wrote a lot of additional code and tests, and became FreeCAD's TNP specialist. He also helped virtually all other developers out to adapt to the new algorithm. This release is dedicated to him.

== General == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:118-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:TNP_fix_relnotes_1.0.PNG|320px]]
| The long-standing [[Topological_naming_problem|Topological naming problem]] has finally been addressed thanks to the joint effort and hard work of several developers. [https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Topological-Naming-Algorithm Realthunder's algorithm] has been carefully implemented and improved to work in the master version of FreeCAD. The project took over a year, and the initial implementation has been finalized with the following PR enabling the improvements. The TNP problem is not completely solved and further improvements will follow in the next version.

| [[File:AssemblyExample_relnotes_1.0.png|320px]]
| FreeCAD has a new built-in [[Assembly_Workbench|Assembly Workbench]], based on the original work done for what we used to call "[https://www.askoh.com/freecad/what_is_freecad/index.html the other FreeCAD]", another software, also named FreeCAD, with motion simulation capabilities created at the same time as ours. The porting has been done by the other FreeCAD's author himself, [https://www.askoh.com Dr. Aik-Siong Koh], and with this dramatic move both FreeCADs are now finally united. Read below for [[#Assembly_Workbench|more information]].

=== Further user interface improvements === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:55-->
* A project unit system was introduced. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9521 Pull request #9521]
* The [[Part_SectionCut|Section Cut]] tool now also works in a perspective view. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10143 Pull request #10143]
* An option to sort workbenches alphabetically (available after right-clicking in ''Preferences → Workbenches'') was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10363 Pull request #10363]
* A '''Find file''' filter and a '''Find in files''' filter were added to the [[Std_DlgMacroExecute|Std DlgMacroExecute]] dialog. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10714 Pull request #10714]
* The [[Std_View_Menu|View menu]] and the View toolbar have been revised. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10761 Pull request #10761]
* The stop button was removed from the [[Macros|Macro toolbar]]. The [[Std_DlgMacroRecord|record button]] now switched to a stop button when recording is in progress. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10836 Pull request #10836]
* The reset button in the Preferences now shows a menu with options to reset the settings at different levels: all, in the current group or in the current tab. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10688 Pull request #10688] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11038 Pull request #11038]
* The Help Module was merged so that it's no longer necessary to download an add-on to make use of it. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11008 Pull request #11008]
* Preferences to customize the current theme were added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10238 Pull request #10238]
* Default selection settings were changed to make the selection of objects in the 3D window easier. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11187 Pull request #11187]
* A meters-only unit scheme named '''Meter decimal''' was added since the MKS (m/kg/s/degree) system doesn't always result in dimensions being displayed in meters - millimeters are still used for values below 0.1 m while for some applications (e.g. civil engineering) a unit system that actually changes the display of all dimensions to meters is useful. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11365 Pull request #11365]
* Additional marker sizes (20, 25 and 30px) were added to ''Preferences → Display → 3D View → Marker size'' in order to assist users of 4K screens. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11524 Pull request #11524]
* A ''Toggle transparency'' option was added to the View and context menus to quickly switch transparency on or off for selected objects. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10805 Pull request #10805]
* A Lock toolbars command was added. With it toolbar positions can be locked or unlocked. It is available in the View menu and the toolbar area context menu. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11596 Pull request #11596]
* Default shape color was adjusted to improve the appearance of the models. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12380 Pull request #12380] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12488 Pull request #12488]
* Items within Part and Group containers can now be sorted by drag and drop. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12293 Pull request #12293]
* Visibility icons (eye symbol) are added to tree objects if the Show visibility icon option is checked in ''Preferences → Display → UI''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12298 Pull request #12298]
* A [[Std_ToggleFreeze|frozen]] status (''Toggle freeze'' option in the context menu in the [[Tree_view|tree]]) was added, making it possible to turn off the parametric behavior of an object (so that it doesn't change even if the objects it depends on change). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12580 Pull request #12580]
* Navigation animations have been improved. Animations now use an easing function and have a fixed duration which can be changed in ''Preferences → Display → Navigation''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10881 Pull request #10881] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12205 Pull request #12205]
* The buttons for the default views are now grouped under a single button. The individual buttons are still available in the additional ''Individual views'' toolbar. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12878 Pull request #12878]
* The name of the current active document is now also displayed in the window title bar. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12035 Pull request #12035]
* A command to display the [[Property editor|Property View]] panel was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12024 Pull request #12024]
* The integration of 3Dconnexion devices with FreeCAD on Windows was improved. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12929 Pull request #12929]
* A Quick Measure feature was added. It uses the [[Status_bar|Status bar]] to display key measurement information (edge length, face area, distance/angle between points/edges and radius of circular edges/cylindrical faces) about the current selection in the 3D view. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12217 Pull request #12217]
* Toolbars can now be dragged and dropped to the status and menu bars. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13571 Pull request #13571]
* A ''Reload stylesheet'' button was added to aid the stylesheet development. It doesn't belong to any toolbar by default, it has to be added manually from ''Tools → Customize → Toolbars → View''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13982 Pull request #13982]
* Document icons (including the [[Std_Open|Open]] and [[Std_Save|Save]] ones, among others) were improved and unified. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13865 Pull request #13865]
* The [[Std_ViewFitAll|Fit all]] icon was replaced for clarity. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14180 Pull request #14180]
* Multiple core icons (such as [[Std_New|New]]) were improved. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14278 Pull request #14278], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14434 Pull request #14434] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14154 Pull request #14154]
* Icons of the Sketcher and Part Design task panel headers were improved. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13968 Pull request #13968]
* In [[Headless_FreeCAD |headless mode]] the interactive Python console now features tab-completion, provided the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html readline] module is available. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14213 Pull request #14213]
* An option to display internal names in the tree view was added. It's disabled by default and can be activated in ''Preferences → Display → UI → Hide Internal Names''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14237 Pull request #14237]
* The Help button was removed from the Preferences because it was non-functional. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14695 Pull request #14695]
* Default stylesheets were improved significantly and are now offered in two variants other than classic - light and dark. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13772 Pull request #13772]
* The Theme and UI pages in the Display group of the Preferences have been reorganized and combined. Some preferences have been moved to the new Advanced page. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14974 Pull request #14974]
* The Part/Part Design check and refine preferences are now activated by default. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14406 Pull request #14406]
* A new parameter was added - '''BaseApp/Preferences/Bitmaps/Theme/UseIconTheme''' (boolean): Set to true to force Qt to use icons from the system's icon theme. The default is false so FreeCAD will use its own icons. It does not affect other Qt icon theme mechanisms such as system dialogs, buttons and others. Those should always use the icons from the system theme. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16018 Pull request #16018]
* Stylesheet, theme and QtStyle information is now included in ''Help → About FreeCAD''. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16281 Pull request #16281]
* Splash screen is now randomly selected on startup from multiple images including user models and presentations of some of the add-on workbenches. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16071 Pull request #16071]
* A safe mode was added and can be activated via ''Help → Restart in safe mode''. It temporarily disables user configurations, addons, themes and other customizations to run FreeCAD in a "factory reset" state for debugging. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16858 Pull request #16858]

== File format changes == <!--T:137-->

<!--T:138-->
Although precautions have been taken to guarantee that files created with the new 1.0 version can still be opened in older versions of FreeCAD, some new features introduced in 1.0 cannot be understood by earlier versions, and can cause models saved with 1.0 to break or present problems when opened in earlier versions of FreeCAD. Here is a summary of possible issues you might encounter and their solution. The forum community can also provide help in fixing compatibility issues.

<!--T:139-->
* the '''Attachment''' property has been renamed to '''AttachmentSupport'''. This means features relying on that property (most notably models using the Assembly4 addon) will need to be fixed to be opened in an earlier version of FreeCAD. A [[Macro_Convert_021|macro is available here]] to fix those files.

== Core system and API == <!--T:10-->

=== Core === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:56-->
* Vector functions from the [[Vector_API|Vector API]] can now be used in [[Expressions|Expressions]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10237 Pull request #8603].
* The Python editor now matches indentation of the previous line when pressing the enter key. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11356 Pull request #11356].
* The name of the property holding the reference object(s) of an attachment has changed from {{PropertyData|Support}} to {{PropertyData|AttachmentSupport}}. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12714 Pull request #12714].
* A property container, App::VarSet, has been introduced as a core feature. A VarSet allows users to define properties that can be used in models just as spreadsheet aliases and other previous property containers (Dynamic Data, Path PropertyBags, and Assembly 4 Variables). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12135 Pull Request #12135]

=== API === <!--T:12-->

==== New Python API ==== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:53-->
* {{Incode|getUpDirection}}: Gets the up-direction from a View3DInventor view. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10060 Pull request #10060]

==== Changed Python API ==== <!--T:128-->

<!--T:129-->
* To save/restore custom data from a Python feature, the previously called methods {{Incode|__getstate__}}/{{Incode|__setstate__}} have been renamed to {{Incode|dumps}}/{{Incode|loads}}. This is due to internal changes in Python-3.11. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10769 Pull request #10769] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12243 Pull request #12243].

== Start == <!--T:49-->

<!--T:132-->
The Start Workbench has been replaced by a Start page, a QtWidgets-based app. It can be displayed using the ''Help → Start'' option. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13134 Pull request #13134]

<!--T:133-->
The first two pull requests mentioned below belong to the Start Workbench, but have informed the design of the Start page.

<!--T:50-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Start_page_template_buttons_new_relnotes_1.0.png|384px]]
| A '''New file''' section that includes a number of quick-start buttons has been added to the Start Page.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10171 Pull request #10171]
|}

<!--T:62-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Start_page_layout_relnotes_1.0.png|384px]]
| The visual design of the Start Page has been overhauled. It now looks more modern and consistent.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10391 Pull request #10391]
|}

<!--T:117-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:First_start_relnotes_1.0.png|384px]]
| A simple first start widget was added and will be extended in the near future.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13650 Pull request #13650]
|}

== Assembly Workbench == <!--T:93-->

<!--T:94-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:Assembly_relnotes_1.0.png|384px]]
| A built-in [[Assembly_Workbench|Assembly workbench]] was finally added to FreeCAD. It uses the open-source [https://github.com/Ondsel-Development/OndselSolver Ondsel solver]. Basic functionalities (joints) are already available. Further development is in progress.
[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10427 Pull request #10427], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10764 Pull request #10764], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12406 Pull request #12406] and more
|}

=== Further Assembly improvements === <!--T:95-->

<!--T:120-->
* An [[Assembly_CreateView|Exploded View]] was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12419 Pull request #12419]
* Assembly icons were updated and the experimental features exposed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13866 Pull request #13866]
* Angle, Perpendicular and Parallel joints were added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14008 Pull request #14008]
* A [[Assembly_CreateBom|Bill of Materials]] feature was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14198 Pull request #14198]
* Support for the [[Topological_naming_problem|TNP]] mitigation code was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14674 Pull request #14674]
* Flexible sub-assemblies support was added. Sub-assemblies added to a parent assembly can be defined as rigid (a solid unit) or flexible (allow movement of their individual components). Manual steps are required for those sub-assemblies added during the development cycle prior to merging this feature. Those assemblies will need to be removed and re-added to their parent assembly. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15629 Pull request #15629]

== BIM Workbench == <!--T:16-->

<!--T:135-->
{| cellpadding=5
| [[File:bim_relnotes_1.0.png|384px]]
| The Arch Workbench has finally been merged with [[BIM_Workbench|BIM]], becoming the new BIM workbench. The new BIM workbench keeps all the tools from Arch, and adds a few more, and brings many refinements to the whole BIM and architectural design workflow, plus better setup and management tools, and better IFC support. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13783 Pull request #13783]
|}

=== Further BIM improvements === <!--T:136-->

<!--T:91-->
* Coming from the BIM workbench, some "all-in-one" Arch tools have been split into different use cases: The [[Arch_BuildingPart|Arch BuildingPart]] tool has been split into the [[Arch_Building|BIM Building]] and [[Arch_Floor|BIM Level]] tools, the [[Arch_Structure|Arch Structure]] tool has been split into [[BIM_Column|BIM Column]], [[BIM_Beam|BIM Beam]] and [[BIM_Slab|BIM Slab]], and the [[Arch_Window|Arch Window]] tool has been split into [[Arch Window|BIM Window]] and [[BIM_Door|BIM Door]]. Internally, those tools still produce the same object, only with different IFC types and presets applied. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13783 Pull request #13783]
* [https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD-NativeIFC NativeIFC] has also been merged into the new BIM workbench. With NativeIFC, you can now work on IFC files in FreeCAD natively, with no more translation to and from the FreeCAD file format. Read more on the [[NativeIFC|NativeIFC]] page. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13783 Pull request #13783]
* The [[Arch_CutPlane|Arch CutPlane]] command has been improved. It is now nesting and link aware and the selection is more flexible. Edges can also be selected making the Arch CutLine<!--Do not add link--> command obsolete. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11254 Pull request #11254] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11792 Pull request #11792]
* The BIM preferences have been checked and improved. The pages in the [[Preferences_Editor|Preferences Editor]] have a new layout. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11940 Pull request #11940] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12038 Pull request #12038]
* An ''Opening only'' preset has been added to the [[Arch_Window|Arch Window]] command. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12209 Pull request #12209]
* The [[Arch_Roof|Arch Roof]] object now has a ''Subvolume'' property. This allows to use a custom solid object as the subtraction volume for a roof. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12346 Pull request #12346]
* Furthermore for an [[Arch_Roof|Arch Roof]] object that uses a solid object as its ''Base'' an appropriate subtraction volume is now automatically generated. Just as a wire-based roof, such a roof can be subtracted from the walls of a building with [[Arch_Remove|Arch Remove]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13221 Pull request #13221]
* The [[Arch_Reference|Arch Reference]] tool has been upgraded: reference objects can now use whole file contents instead of having to choose a part, support for DXF and IFC files has been added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13287 Pull request #13287]
* FreeCAD now has a new BIM example file. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14937 Pull request #14937]
* The new BIM workbench also offers a series of new management tools, to help you set up your project, or bulk manage IFC properties of your objects. Read more on the [[BIM_Workbench|BIM Workbench]] page.
* [[IfcOpenShell|IfcOpenShell]], another piece of open-source software needed to work with IFC files in FreeCAD, is now bundled in all official installer packages offered by the FreeCAD team. If you get FreeCAD from a third-party provider, such as your Linux distribution, where IfcOpenShell has not made it yet as an official package, the BIM workbench offers a utility tool to download and install IfcOpenShell. And if you have no use for IFC, the BIM workbench still works 100% without IfcOpenShell.
* The toolbars and menus of the BIM Workbench were reworked. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14087 Pull request #14087]

== CAM Workbench == <!--T:32-->

<!--T:102-->
* The Path Workbench is now named CAM. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12665 Pull request #12665]

=== Further CAM improvements === <!--T:33-->

<!--T:125-->
* Rest machining was reimplemented to take input from the G-code of earlier operations (instead of using the internals of [[CAM_Area|Area]] operations). This enables support for rest machining in Area operations after non-Area ones (most notably Adaptive). [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11939 Pull request #11939]
* G43 tool height compensation was added to the centroid CAM post-processor. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12652 Pull request #12652]
* A ''Feed retract'' option was added to drilling operation settings for reaming and boring. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13254 Pull request #13254]
* A new CAM simulator based on low-level OpenGL functions (faster and more precise) was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13884 Pull request #13884] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15597 Pull request #15597]
* The [[CAM_Vcarve|Vcarve]] operation was reworked to include features commonly available in other CAM software (Step down, Finishing pass, Head movement optimization and debugVoronoi method) making it possible to drastically improve the carved surface quality while increasing the carving speed up to 50%. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14093 Pull request #14093]
* Machinability material models were added along with several materials. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14460 Pull request #14460], [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15910 Pull request #15910] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16021 Pull request #16021]

== Draft Workbench == <!--T:18-->

=== Further FEM improvements === <!--T:22-->

<!--T:57-->
* The ''Model → Constraints without solver'' menu was removed from the GUI. The listed constraints could not be used. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10457 Pull request #10457] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10459 Pull request #10459]
* The word "constraint" was removed from the names and descriptions of most features in the FEM workbench to ensure the correct nomenclature. The names were changed in such a way to fit the standards in the FEA industry and to make them intuitive for new users. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10519 Pull request #10519] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10799 Pull request #10799]
* New icons were added for [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|Solver CalculiX Standard]], [[FEM_SolverControl|Solver job control]] and [[FEM_SolverRun|Run solver calculations]] for greater intuitiveness. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10885 Pull request #10885]
* Solver CalculiX (new framework) was removed from the GUI since it's unfinished and unnecessary at the moment. Its examples were also removed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/10823 Pull request #10823] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12876 Pull request #12876]
* The layout of some postprocessing tool task panels was improved to reduce the size of the horizontal space occupied by them. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11066 Pull request #11066]

* The magnitude of gravity acceleration can now be changed using the properties of [[FEM_ConstraintSelfWeight|FEM ConstraintSelfWeight]]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12044 Pull request #12044]
* [[FEM_ConstraintContact|Contact]] and [[FEM_ConstraintTie|tie constraint]] were significantly improved. Contact stiffness now uses the correct unit and stick slope value can be specified for friction in contact. Moreover, clearance adjustment can be specified for contact while tie constraint may have adjustment enabled or disabled. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12133 Pull request #12133]
* PaStiX and Pardiso were added to supported [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools#Properties|CalculiX matrix solvers]]. They are the fastest ccx solvers but the possibility of using them depends on the CalculiX binary version and available additional libraries. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12478 Pull request #12478]
* The ''Beam Reduced Integration'' property (set to ''true'' by default) was added to [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver settings]].

* The ''Beam Shell Result Output 3D'' property of the [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver]] is now set to ''true'' by default to provide results for beam elements and provide meaningful results for shell elements. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12493 Pull request #12493]
* Symbols of analysis features are now properly positioned when the Body (or Part container) has modified placement property. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12527 Pull request #12527]
* [[FEM_ConstraintPressure|Pressure load]] is now working properly for shells regardless of the mesh groups setting. This setting can be changed in the Preferences. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12437 Pull request #12437]
* Simple hardening in [[FEM_MaterialMechanicalNonlinear|FEM MaterialMechanicalNonlinear]] was renamed to isotropic hardening. Moreover, kinematic hardening was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12666 Pull request #12666]
* Now geometric nonlinearity is not automatically activated and required when a nonlinear material is used. Those are independent forms of nonlinearity. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12703 Pull request #12703]
* Mixed meshes consisting of both triangular and quadrilateral elements are now displayed properly in the results pipeline. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12740 Pull request #12740]
* The ''Output Frequency'' property was added to [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver settings]]. It defines the frequency of output writing in increments. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12672 Pull request #12672]
* Second-order quadrilateral elements can now be generated. Previously, the 2nd order Gmsh setting was generating 1st order quad elements because of the lack of a ''SecondOrderIncomplete'' Gmsh command which is now used internally. Those elements can also be used for 2D analyses. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12698 Pull request #12698] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12774 Pull request #12774]
* The determination of beam cross-section orientation was partially fixed. Due to a bug in the current release of CalculiX, there may still be issues with some orientations. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12833 Pull request #12833]
* Cantilever FEM examples on the Start page were updated and a new one using 1D elements was added. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12871 Pull request #12871]
* The format in which FreeCAD writes the [[FEM_ConstraintForce|force constraint]] is now compatible with the CalculiX format, eliminating rare issues with too long numbers. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12932 Pull request #12932]
* It is now possible to export the [[FEM_PostPipelineFromResult|results pipeline]] to the VTK format. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12987 Pull request #12987]
* New incrementation control properties were added to [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver settings]]. Currently, in addition to the initial increment size and time period of the step, one can specify minimum and maximum increment size. Also, the ''Iterations Thermo Mech Maximum'' property was renamed to ''Iterations Maximum'' as it can now be used for static (non-thermomechanical) analyses too. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12662 Pull request #12662]
* Default [[FEM_ElementGeometry2D|2D element thickness]] was changed from 20 mm to 1 mm as it makes more sense in practice. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13077 Pull request #13077]
* Many FEM icons were significantly improved to reduce their similarity and make it more clear what the tools do. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13130 Pull request #13130]
* The ''Thermo Mech Type'' property was added to [[FEM_SolverCalculixCcxtools|CalculiX solver settings]]. It makes it possible to switch a regular (coupled) thermomechanical analysis to uncoupled or a pure heat transfer one. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13296 Pull request #13296]
* ''Min. Size'' property was added for [[FEM_MeshNetgenFromShape|Netgen mesher]] to prevent the generation of too small elements when meshing more complex geometries. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12794 Pull request #12794]
* An old issue with a non-functioning symbol scale property for FEM constraints was finally fixed and the ''Scale'' property can now be used to adjust the size of symbols of a selected constraint. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13274 Pull request #13274]
* Automatic scaling of FEM constraints was improved to better handle very small and very large objects. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13586 Pull request #13586]
* [[FEM_ConstraintHeatflux|Heat flux load]] now has a radiation heat flux mode to model surface radiation to ambient. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13466 Pull request #13466]
* A few unused constraint symbol View properties were removed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13569 Pull request #13569]
* New view properties (with the main one being ''Color Mode'') were added to FEM mesh objects so that custom color and transparency settings for meshes can be saved and restored. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13698 Pull request #13698]
* Now only the last added filter under each results pipeline object is visible by default. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13820 Pull request #13820]
* The task panel tips of several constraints were changed to actually reflect the rules of the geometry selection for those constraints. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13921 Pull request #13921] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14002 Pull request #14002]
* Support for heat flux results from thermomechanical analyses was added to the results pipeline. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14019 Pull request #14019]
* The [[FEM_ConstraintSectionPrint|Section print feature]] was improved, adding support for heat flux and drag stress (not yet available as 3D fluid analyses with CalculiX haven't been implemented yet) results. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14046 Pull request #14046]
* [[FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource|Body heat source]] can now be used with CalculiX and has two input modes - dissipation rate [W/kg] and total power [W]. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14417 Pull request #14417]
* The rotation properties of the [[FEM_ConstraintTransform|Local coordinate system]] were replaced with a single ''Rotation'' property for consistency. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14353 Pull request #14353]
* An [[FEM_CreateElementsSet|Erase Elements]] tool was added to make it possible to hide elements of a mesh selected with a polygon. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/11492 Pull request #11492]
* The three FEM examples on the Start page were replaced with one, containing all three variants of the cantilever beam model (1D, 2D and 3D) in [[Std_Group|Group]] containers. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15786 Pull request #15786]
* The redundant ''Fix'' properties and checkboxes of the [[FEM_ConstraintDisplacement|FEM ConstraintDisplacement]] were removed. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15531 Pull request #15531]
* The behavior of the Cancel buttons in the task panels of the [[FEM_MeshGmshFromShape|Gmsh]] and [[FEM_MeshNetgenFromShape|Netgen]] meshers was fixed so that they can be used to abort ongoing meshing which is particularly important when an initial guess regarding element size is too low. Moreover, the Netgen mesher was implemented, finally making it possible to use it on all systems, including Linux. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16515 Pull request #16515] and [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/16433 Pull request #16433]
* The ''Quasi-structured Quad'' 2D algorithm missing in the Gmsh mesher was added to it along with other fixes. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15624 Pull request #15624]

[https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/13833 Pull request #13833]
* Now all the Part Design features use the same icons for the toolbar and the tree. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14074 Pull request #14074]
* A new ''Transform body'' mode was added to Part Design mirror and pattern tools, making it possible to transform the whole base feature's shape instead of the individual tool shapes of additive and subtractive features. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/12589 Pull request #12589]
* The layout of the [[PartDesign_Hole|Hole]] tool dialog was improved. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/14031 Pull request #14031]
* The [[PartDesign_Migrate|Migrate]] tool was removed from GUI since it was only useful for migrations between versions that are now highly outdated. [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/15196 Pull request #15196]

Depending on the preference setting On-View-Parameters, they can be disabled, reduced to dimensions only (no initial coordinates) or fully enabled. Moreover, modes were added for the shape tools. They can be selected using the M key or a drop-down list in the task panel. Some tools have additional settings in the form of checkboxes in the task panel and additional keyboard shortcuts. Currently, the new features are available for points, lines, arcs, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, slots and B-splines.
