Who can help users find Legacy version FreeCAD 16? That is still in high demand.

: Why do you need to use such an old version. Why cant you use FreeCAD 0.20?: https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Release_notes_0.20

:: You did not reply to my question. What exactly is the problem with FreeCAD 0.20? Your link is a crude article that does not tell what the problem with a recent FreeCAD should be. It also implies that FreeCAD is now since 4 years (sic!) developing wrong. I is also a bad habit not to discuss things with the community. If you think, something is wrong, bring it to the forum or send patches.
::Using a 4 year old FreeCAD is definitely not recommended and even a security risk. I also think that 100k+ downloads per month shows that FreeCAD is useful.
