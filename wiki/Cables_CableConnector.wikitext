==Description== <!--T:3-->

<!--T:24-->
New concept of Cable Connector Preset with CableTerminal and SuppLines as child objects: <span style="color:blue;">introduced in version 0.3.0</span>

<!--T:4-->
The [[Image:Cables_CableConnector.svg|24px]] [[Cables_CableConnector|Cable Connector]] represents a model of an electrical connector. Its shape can be selected from [[#Data|{{PropertyData|Preset}}]] list upon creation. There are two shape types available: first one fully parametric called 'ParametricTerminal' and second one called 'Fixed'.

<!--T:25-->
The 'ParametricTerminal' type creates a parametric connector object. The connector is a model of electrically conductive metal block (for simplicity without external insulation). From an electrical point of view, all wires connected to a connector form one electrical node. The connector has default size upon creation, but some parameters, like '''Height''', '''Hole Size''', '''Hole Diameter''' or '''Number of Holes''' can be changed during creation after selection 'Customized' preset or later by changing properties. In this mode the single [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] is created, split to segments passing through each connector hole.

<!--T:26-->
The 'Fixed' type creates non parametric connector object with a shape taken from external [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303 STEP] file. There are a few predefined STEP connector models shipped together with Cables Workbench. In addition, the user can create their own connector library, this is described in [[#Cable Connector Presets|Cable Connector Presets]]. In this mode the certain number of [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]]s are created with predefined size and position corresponding to connector pins. Additionally one or more [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] objects can be created forming the basis for the cable entering the connector.

<!--T:27-->
The '''Cable Connector''' belongs to the [[Arch_Component|Arch Component]] class and inherits all of its properties.

<!--T:6-->
'''Cable Connector''' object can be colored by attaching desired [[Arch_SetMaterial|Material]] to the '''Material''' property. [[Arch_MultiMaterial|MultiMaterial]] is also supported. It can be used to change the original connector colors to those defined in the multimaterial composition. Important: the number of colors in the multimaterial must match the number of original colors of the connector.

==Usage== <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
# Select the vertex, point on surface or object in the [[3D_View|3D View]] or select nothing.
# Create Cable Connector by one of these methods:
#* Press the {{Button|[[Image:Cables_CableConnector.svg|16px]] [[Cables_CableConnector|Cable Connector]]}} button.
#* Select the {{MenuCommand|Cables → [[Image:Cables_CableConnector.svg|16px]] Cable Connector}} option from the menu.
#* Right-click in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] or the [[3D_View|3D View]] and select the {{MenuCommand|Cables → [[Image:Cables_CableConnector.svg|16px]] Cable Connector}} option from the context menu.
#* Use the keyboard shortcut: {{KEY|C}} then {{KEY|N}}.
# The {{MenuCommand|Cable Connector}} task panel opens. See [[#Options|Options]] for more information.

<!--T:10-->
Once created the Cable Connector is placed at the position of selected vertex, point or object in the 3D space (or at the point (0,0,0) if nothing was selected).

==Options== <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
The '''Cable Connector''' preset available in the task panel can be changed. The currently selected preset is immediately visible in the [[3D_View|3D View]].

<!--T:31-->
When the special 'Customized' preset is selected, the task panel shows additional options allowing to change all the properties of a custom parametric '''Cable Connector'''.

===Cable Connector Presets=== <!--T:32-->

<!--T:33-->
Cables Workbench comes with several predefined shapes. However, the user is not limited to using the default set (the [[Cables_Create_Custom_Connector|Cables Create Custom Connector]] tutorial explains the creation of a custom connector in detail).

<!--T:34-->
An additional CSV file can be created by the user, containing custom Cable Connector Preset definitions. It must be named {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}}, and placed in:

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=
$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Cables/
}}
<translate>

<!--T:35-->
The {{incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR}} can be obtained from the [[Python_Console|Python Console]]:

</translate>
{{Code|code=
FreeCAD.getUserAppDataDir()
}}
<translate>

<!--T:36-->
The contents of the custom {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} file must be modeled upon the same rules as the [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/freecad/cables/resources/presets/connectorpresets.csv connectorpresets.csv] in the '''Cables Workbench''' source code. The file is self descriptive and can be used as a template for own Presets creation.

<!--T:37-->
The custom {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} file can be modified without restarting FreeCAD. Any changes made there are immediately visible in the list of Presets when making a new Cable Connector from the GUI.

<!--T:38-->
The {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} can contain two preset types: [[#ParametricTerminal PresetType|ParametricTerminal PresetType]] and [[#Fixed PresetType|Fixed PresetType]].

====ParametricTerminal PresetType==== <!--T:39-->

<!--T:40-->
This preset type needs only single line in the {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} file to fully describe all the parameters of the given connector. No additional files are needed. There are some details about this type in the [[#Description|Description]].

====Fixed PresetType==== <!--T:41-->

<!--T:42-->
The definition of this type is more complex then the previous one. The preset line in the {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} file among other parameters defines names of two additional preset files:
* STEP file with the shape and colors of the connector. The name of this file has to be put directly (file example: [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/Dummy_Dummy.step Dummy_Dummy.step])<sup>[[#STEP_Source|[1]]]</sup>.

<!--T:43-->
* CSV file with placements of the connector body, parameters for all attached [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]]s and [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]]. The name of this file is made from concatenation of ''ConnectorClass'' and ''Name'' fields (file example: [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/Connector_Dummy.csv Connector_Dummy.csv]).

<!--T:44-->
This two additional files (STEP and CSV) have to be placed in:

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=
$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Cables/lib
}}
<translate>

<!--T:45-->
In fact the software will look for these files in one more place (which should be treated as read only):

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=
$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Mod/Cables/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/
}}
<translate>

<!--T:46-->
So it is possible to define similar connectors with the same STEP definition but different number of Terminals or their placement if needed.

=====More details about Fixed PresetType in connectorpresets.csv file=====

</translate>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<translate>
The single preset line of {{FileName|connectorpresets.csv}} contains the following information for the software analyzing this file:
* ''Name'' and ''Connector Class'' fields are used by the software to look for a valid CSV description file name. It is constructed as ''Connector Class''_''Name''.csv (for example {{FileName|Connector_Dummy.csv}} if ''Connector Class''={{value|Connector}} and ''Name''={{value|Dummy}}). This file should exist in a {{Incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Cables/lib/}} or {{Incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Mod/Cables/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/}}. If not, an error message will be generated.
* The ''PresetType'' (second field) has to have value = {{value|Fixed}}. It informs that the shape will be created from an external STEP file.
* The ''StepFileName'' field contains file name (with extension) of a STEP file used to create a shape. This file should exist in a {{Incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Cables/lib/}} or {{Incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Mod/Cables/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/}}. If not, an error message will be generated.
* ''NrOfTerminals'', ''NrOfSuppLines'' define the number of [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] and [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] objects to create. Details for these objects have to be defined in CSV description file mentioned above. If the numbers defined here do not match the number of definitions in the CSV description file, an error message will be generated.

The above approach to creating presets allows to use the same STEP file for different versions of presets with different CSV description files. It can be useful e.g. for creating connector variants with different pin descriptions, different number of used terminals, supplines etc.

=====Example of Fixed PresetType=====

</translate>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<translate>

<!--T:48-->
As a template and example the {{Value|Connector_Dummy}} preset can be taken:

<!--T:49-->
The preset definition line is in the file [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/freecad/cables/resources/presets/connectorpresets.csv connectorpresets.csv]:

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=Dummy,Fixed,Connector,Dummy_Dummy.step,3,1}}
<translate>

<!--T:50-->
Where the fields represent the following:

</translate>
{{Code|lang=text|code=Name,Fixed,ConnectorClass,StepFileName,NrOfTerminals,NrOfSuppLines}}
<translate>

<!--T:51-->
From the above definition it follows that the file {{FileName|Dummy_Dummy.step}} and {{FileName|Connector_Dummy.csv}} (filename built from ''ConnectorClass_Name.csv'') have to be present in one of the folders mentioned above.

<!--T:52-->
After checking, the {{FileName|Dummy_Dummy.step}} and {{FileName|Connector_Dummy.csv}} files can be found in {{incode|$FREECAD_USER_DIR/Mod/Cables/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/}}.

<!--T:53-->
As a result of definitions from these three files the new '''Cable Connector''' with three '''CableTerminal'''s and single '''SuppLines''' can be created.

=====STEP File=====

</translate>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<translate>

Since [[Cables_Workbench|Cables Workbench]] <span style="color:blue;">version 0.3.2</span> any of properly made STEP file should load into connector without errors. This includes multishape STEP files and STEP files without color defined.

Probably still some STEP files will not load properly into the connector. To prevent this, import downloaded step file into FreeCAD directly (via File/Import menu) and export it back to STEP file. This will rebuild entire structure of the downloaded file. Reducing the number of shapes in a single STEP file can also help. FreeCAD supports STEP AP242, but in case of problems an older version (e.g AP203) can be tried.

If everything fails, such a problematic STEP files can be reported to the workbench author: [[User:SargoDevel|SargoDevel]] for further analysis.

=====STEP Source===== <!--T:54-->

</translate>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
<translate>
<!--T:55-->
Each STEP file from predefined preset has also its source file attached (example: [https://github.com/sargo-devel/Cables/blob/master/freecad/cables/resources/presets/lib/Dummy_Dummy.FCStd Dummy_Dummy.FCStd]). Inside each source file there is information on how to correctly generate a STEP file with colors from the source shape. These source files can be used as a base for creating shapes for new connectors.

==Notes== <!--T:11-->

<!--T:56-->
* The [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] and [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] objects have reversed relation with their '''Cable Connector''' parent to avoid cyclic dependencies. They are shown as a children in the [[Tree_View|Tree View]] only for visual organization of objects. Undesirable consequence: when the '''Cable Connector''' is copied, all its child CableTerminal and SuppLines objects must always be manually copied with it.
* [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] or [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] child objects are created automatically depending on '''Preset''', their shape and placement are controlled by '''Cable Connector'''.

==Properties== <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
A '''Cable Connector''' object shares the common properties and behaviors of all [[Arch_Component|Arch Components]].

===Data=== <!--T:15-->

<!--T:57-->
{{TitleProperty|Component}}

<!--T:58-->
Some most frequently used properties from the group are described here. The rest is available at [[Arch_Component#Data|Arch Component]]

<!--T:59-->
* {{PropertyData|Base|Link}}: An external shape of any [[Part_Workbench|Shape]]-based base object can be used here. This will replace the default method of shape creaction and an external shape will be used. '''Number Of Terminals''' and '''Number Of Supp Lines''' parameters become visible and can be changed if Base property is not None.

<!--T:16-->
{{TitleProperty|Cable Connector}}

<!--T:17-->
* {{PropertyData|Height|Length}}: Specifies the height of the connector. The default height is 5 mm.
* {{PropertyData|Hole Size|Length}}: Specifies the size of holes in mm<sup>2</sup>. The default hole size is 2 mm<sup>2</sup>.
* {{PropertyData|Number of Holes|Integer}}: Specifies the number of holes. The default value is 3.
* {{PropertyData|Number Of Supp Lines|Integer}}: (hidden by default) Specifies the number of a [[Cables_SuppLines|SuppLines]] child objects. The default value is 0.
* {{PropertyData|Number Of Terminals|Integer}}: (hidden by default) Specifies the number of a [[Cables_CableTerminal|CableTerminal]] child objects. The default value is 1.
* {{PropertyData|Preset|Enumeration}}: Specifies the predefined set of parameters for Cable Connector. The default preset is {{Value|TerminalStrip_2.5mm2_x3}}.
* {{PropertyData|Thickness|Length}}: Specifies the thickness of the wall between the hole and external surface of connector. The default thickness is 1 mm.

==Tutorials== <!--T:60-->

<!--T:61-->
* [[Cables_Create_Custom_Connector|Cables Create Custom Connector]] describes the creation of a connector with a [[#Fixed_PresetType|Fixed PresetType]].

==Typical workflow== <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
This workflow shows how to build a connector, a cable box, a cable and how one subwire of cable can be passed through the one of connector holes.

<!--T:20-->
# Create a '''Cable Box''' and a '''Cable''' attached to it as described in [[Cables_CableBox#Typical workflow| Cable Box Typical workflow]].
# Select the '''Cable Box''' in a [[Tree_View|Tree View]] and create a '''Cable Connector''' as described in [[#Usage|Usage]].
# Move the '''Cable Connector''' to the desired position using e.g. [[Std_TransformManip|TransformManip]] tool.
# Attach the '''Cable Connector''' to the '''Cable Box''' using [[Cables_AttachInPlace|Attach In Place]] tool.
# Hide the '''Cable Box''' and '''Cable''' shapes in a [[Tree_View|Tree View]] e.g. by pressing {{KEY|SPACE}} key. The cable subwires should be still visible.
# Attach the end point of longest subwire created in step 1 to the first '''CableTerminal''' segment by using [[Cables_AttachWireToTerminal|Attach Wire To Terminal]] tool ('''CableTerminal''' is a child object of the '''Cable Connector''').
# Unhide '''Cable''' and '''Cable Box''' shapes in a [[Tree_View|Tree View]] e.g. by pressing {{KEY|SPACE}} key.
