== Page Structure ==

The Tools section comes much later. Wouldn't it be better if we put some parts like the Filiping section in the best practices and adjust the page structure somehow, @[[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]]? Also, thanks for the new addition. [[User:Reqrefusion|Reqrefusion]] ([[User talk:Reqrefusion|talk]]) 20:18, 5 August 2025 (UTC)

:I have adjusted the order. "Tools" is now the 4th paragraph. I want to keep "Constraints" and "Profile sketches" after the introduction as they explain key concepts. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 07:33, 6 August 2025 (UTC)
