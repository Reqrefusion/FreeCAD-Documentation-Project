== Entering point coordinates into FreeCAD ==

I need to enter many points with XY Z coordinates into FreeCAD. I have tried some of my points without success. I have tried the example given that has 

0 0 0

1.4562 -7.2354 12.2367

5.9423 3.1728 -17.6439

as a set of points but FreeCAD does not accept them. I must not have something set up right. Please help me enter points into FreeCAD by giving a working example and its configuration. [[Special:Contributions/65.65.158.97|65.65.158.97]] 21:01, 2 January 2026 (UTC)
