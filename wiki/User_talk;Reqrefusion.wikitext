== Talk pages should not be used for forum questions ==

Hi,

I see that you approve new Talk pages used for questions that belong in the forum. IMO we should not do that. Talk pages should discuss the content of the Wiki page they belong to. [[User:Roy 043|Roy 043]] ([[User talk:Roy 043|talk]]) 07:19, 4 August 2025 (UTC)

:I automatically approve posts if they aren't spam or vandalism. However, if you do, I'd be more selective on talk pages. [[User:Reqrefusion|Reqrefusion]] ([[User talk:Reqrefusion|talk]]) 10:23, 4 August 2025 (UTC)
