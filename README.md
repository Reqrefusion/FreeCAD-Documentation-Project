## Backstory

While I was thinking about what the project did,  
I thought it would be nice to name it Gordian Knot. 

Because in my opinion, APIs are a thread and  
this project connects these APIs together. 

Unlike other projects, it does it  
without separating it into threads. 

Actually, this idiom is about using brute force, but since  
it's the most famous knot in history, it's probably okay.
